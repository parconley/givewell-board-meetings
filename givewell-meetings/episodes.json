          "text": "Clear Fund Board Meeting 6/22/07 \nAttachment C: Review of Compensation \n \nContext \n \nI. Executive Director compensation for 3 comparable organizations \n \nAlthough the Clear Fund is an unconventional organization, Holden Karnofsky, asked \nJason McGill, Director of Membership at the New York Regional Association of \nGrantmakers, to name appropriate comparables.  Their exchange is attached.  Jason \nnamed four organizations, of which we were able to locate Form 990s (relevant pages \nattached) for three, with the stipulation that the Clear Fund's budget – and therefore \nappropriate compensation – is lower than that of these comparables. \n \nNew York Women's Foundation, a small public foundation located in New York \nCity. \no Total expenses: $3,023,293.00. \no Executive Director compensation (excluding benefits): $129,231.00 for 40 \nhrs/week. \no Program Director compensation (excluding benefits): $87,258.00 for 40 \nhrs/week. \nThird Wave Foundation, a small public foundation located in New York City. \no Total expenses: $657,468.00 \no Executive Director compensation: $51,827.00 for 40 hrs/week. \no Other officer compensation: N/A. \nNorth Star Fund, a small public foundation located in New York City. \no Total expenses: $1,072,280.00 \no Executive Director compensation: $67,015.00 for 40 hrs/week. \no Other officer compensation: N/A. \n \nII. Data from NPCCNY's salary survey \n \nCraig Weinrich of the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York, in an exchange \nwith Holden Karnofsky (attached), disclosed the following data about salaries at \nnonprofits with budgets and areas of focus comparable to those of The Clear Fund. \n \nFor nonprofits in the area of health and human services with annual budgets \nbetween $400,000 and $700,000, the median Executive Director salary is $68,000 \n(ann.); the median Deputy Director salary is $48,000 (ann.) \nFor nonprofits in the area of public societal benefit with annual budgets between \n$400,000 and $700,000, the median Executive Director salary is $74,000 (ann.); \nDeputy Director data is not available. \n \nIII. Roles of Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld \n \n\nThe Clear Fund's 2007 budget is approximately $250,000; on an annualized basis, this \ntranslates to approximately $500,000. \n \nHolden Karnofsky will serve as Executive Director, and expects to work approximately \n80 hours per week.  Elie Hassenfeld will serve as Program Officer, and expects to work \nin excess of 60 hours per week. \n \nProposal \n \nHolden Karnofsky, Executive Director: An annualized salary of $68,600 (including \nbenefits). \n \nElie Hassenfeld, Program Officer: An annualized salary of $68,600 (including \nbenefits). \n \nThese salaries are within range of the comparable salaries discussed above. \n \nBefore voting \n \nBefore voting on the proposal regarding compensation, please affirm each of the \nfollowing: \n \n1. I am not the person who is the subject of the compensation arrangement, or a \nfamily member of such person;  \n \n2. I am not in an employment relationship subject to the direction or control of the \nperson who is the subject of the compensation arrangement; \n \n3. I do not receive compensation or other payments subject to approval by the \nperson who is the subject of the compensation arrangement; \n \n4. I have no material financial interest affected by the compensation arrangement; \nand \n \n5. I am not approving a transaction providing economic benefits to the person \nwho is the subject of the compensation arrangement, who in turn has approved or \nwill approve a transaction providing benefits to the board or committee member.  \n\nExchange between Holden Karnofsky and Jason McGill of NYRAG \nHi Holden: \n  \nEach of the following organizations runs a budget that is currently larger than \nThe Clear Fund,  but each is a relatively modest-sized public foundation and is \ntherefore in the ballpark, grantmaking-wise, of what I understand to be your first \ngrantmaking plateau goal for the Fund.  I think these would make a reasonable \ncomparison for due diligence on compensation (although you'll likely set your \nsalary below what these folks make). \n  \nYou should be able to find their 990s online.  Let me know if the numbers leave \nyou needing additional examples. \n  \nNew York Women's Foundation \nThe North Star Fund \nTwenty-First Century Foundation \nThird Wave Foundation \n  \n  \nYrs-- \n  \nJason \n  \n_______________________________________ \nJason McGill \nDirector, Member Services \nNYRAG: New York Regional Association of Grantmakers \n79 Fifth Avenue, Fourth Floor \nNew York, NY 10003 \nPhone: 212/714-0699 x 203 \nFax: 212/239-2075 \ne-mail: jmcgill@nyrag.org \nWeb: www.nyrag.org \nplease consider the environment before printing this e-mail \n \n \nFrom: holden0@gmail.com [mailto:holden0@gmail.com] On Behalf Of Holden \nSent: Wednesday, June 20, 2007 11:59 AM \nTo: Jason McGill \nSubject: Comparables for The Clear Fund \n\nHi Jason, \n \nThanks again for speaking with me just now.  As I mentioned over the phone, we are \nlooking for the names of nonprofit organizations that would be appropriate comparables \nfor The Clear Fund, for the purpose of setting an appropriate level of compensation for \nour officers.  Since you are well placed to know the landscape of grantmakers in New \nYork, and you have a thorough understanding of The Clear Fund (its budget, its work, \nand its mission), I'd appreciate if you could send the names of the nonprofits you know of \nthat are most similar to - and thus most appropriate for compensation reference for - The \nClear Fund.  \n \nThanks, \nHolden \n\n \nExchange between Holden Karnofsky and Craig Weinrich of NPCCNY \n \nSee answers below... \n  \nCraig Weinrich \nMembership, Outreach & IT Director \nNonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York \n1350 Broadway, Suite 1801 | New York, NY 10018 \n(212) 502-4191 x.30 | www.npccny.org \n  \nAbout Us | Join NPCC | Member Benefits | Government Relations | Workshops \n  \n \n \nFrom: holden0@gmail.com [mailto:holden0@gmail.com] On Behalf Of Holden \nSent: Wednesday, June 20, 2007 12:21 PM \nTo: Craig Weinrich \nSubject: Salary data \nDear Mr. Weinrich, \n \nThanks for speaking with me today.  I would appreciate if you could send me the \nfollowing data: \n \nMedian annualized compensation for Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer \npositions at nonprofits in the area of health and human services, with annualized budgets \nbetween $400,000 and $700,000  $68,000 for ED; $48,000 for Deputy Director  \n \nMedian annualized compensation for Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer \npositions at nonprofits in the area of public societal benefit, with annualized budgets \nbetween $400,000 and $700,000 \n $74,000 for ED; No data for Deputy Director  \nAs we are not yet officially recognized as a 501(c)(3) organization, we can't yet join \nNPCCNY, but we plan on doing so when the opportunity arises.  I look forward to seeing \nyour membership application! \n  \nGood luck.    \n \nThanks, \nHolden Karnofsky \nThe Clear Fund \n "

Although \nsome executives believe these challenges will continue into 2010, most feel \nthat, despite some continuing hardships, their organization’s future is brighter \nthan expected. \nOur NY survey respondents reported a belief in the continuation of a slow and \ngradual recovery and substantial opportunities for organizations that are able to adapt. \nNonprofit leaders understand that they need to be able to navigate through short \nterm challenges so that they can later take advantage of longer term opportunities. \nIt is important for an organization to position itself now for the next stage of the \nrecovering economy.  From our survey this year, it is evident that NY nonprofit \nmanagers are doing exactly that.  A significant number of you have continued your \ncommitment to programs and services and are beginning to hire staff that was laid \noff, filling vacancies, as well as adding new positions.   \nNY organizations, on the whole, maintained salaries at pre-2009 levels and, for \nsome specialties, increased compensation.  Fundraising salaries rose by about 10% and \nhigh level finance salaries increased by about 7%. \nManagers noted that it was difficult to find the talent they needed in the \nmarketplace so when they did, they paid a little more. Even when doing more with \nless is the rule rather than the exception, hiring and maintaining outstanding talent is \nstill the most critical issue for every organization. \nIn year 2009, NY organizations also reported the following: \n39% laid-off staff; 61% did not lay off any staff \n50% froze salaries; 50% offered slight pay increases where appropriate \n22% reduced benefits; 78% continued benefits as is  \n19% reduced programs; 81% continued to provide all programs & services \n24% hired staff to fill critical vacancies \nTemps now represent a large portion of overall employment.  It has become \nimpossible to work without a good reliable temp workforce to lean on. 3327 PNP SALARY SURVEY NY09:Layout 1  2/2/10  1:47 PM  Page 1\n\nASSOCIATIONS, EDUCATION & ARTS ORGANIZATIONS

priority. As organizations position \nthemselves to compete for resources, hiring and retaining the best staff may be the \ndifference between an organization’s success or failure. \nMyth:  No need to worry about staff retention – no one is going anywhere. \nReality: High performing staff, a limited resource, is always hard to find.  Competition for \ntop talent between similar organizations is fierce.  Retaining the best staff is an ongoing \neffort that cannot be presumed.  \nMyth: Candidate rich market means that I will be able to find the talent I need. \nReality: As the economy continues to improve, pent up demand for top performers will \nprevail and the best candidates will be hired quickly.  There are never enough high \nperformers in the marketplace.    \nMyth: Keeping salaries low is expected in this economy. \nReality: Retaining top staff requires that salaries remain competitive within the sector or \nyour best staff will leave to another organization where salaries are higher.  If you lose \ngood staff, the cost to your organization is enormous.    \nMyth: Putting off hiring key staff will save us money. \nReality: The truth is that putting off hiring the staff you need only postpones programs \nand services and promotes missed opportunities to hire incredible employees.  If you wait \ntoo long, someone else will hire the best staff and not you.    \nMyth: Doubling up on jobs is an efficient way to get through the year. \nReality: One of the most inefficient ways to run an organization is to double up on jobs \nproducing poor work, low morale, and a very tired team.  \nMyth: Staffing contracts are only for very large organizations that hire many temps. \nReality: Low cost contracts are available to both large and small organizations regardless \nof the number of temps needed by an organization. \nMyth: There is no way to reduce risk when hiring a new employee.   \nReality:  PNP’s one year guarantee on any Direct Hire placement reduces the risk you \ntake when hiring a new employee.  \nMyth: Finding an Interim Executive is difficult, time consuming, and not essential.   \nReality:  An organization’s ability to function well is impacted when major transitions \noccur.  Having the right Interim Executive can make that transition smooth and \nproductive, and PNP’s roster of available executives makes it easy. \nWe thank Ventureneer/Stengel Solutions for producing our survey.

Although \nsome executives believe these challenges will continue into 2010, most feel \nthat, despite some continuing hardships, their organization’s future is brighter \nthan expected. \nOur NY survey respondents reported a belief in the continuation of a slow and \ngradual recovery and substantial opportunities for organizations that are able to adapt. \nNonprofit leaders understand that they need to be able to navigate through short \nterm challenges so that they can later take advantage of longer term opportunities. \nIt is important for an organization to position itself now for the next stage of the \nrecovering economy.  From our survey this year, it is evident that NY nonprofit \nmanagers are doing exactly that.  A significant number of you have continued your \ncommitment to programs and services and are beginning to hire staff that was laid \noff, filling vacancies, as well as adding new positions.   \nNY organizations, on the whole, maintained salaries at pre-2009 levels and, for \nsome specialties, increased compensation.  Fundraising salaries rose by about 10% and \nhigh level finance salaries increased by about 7%. \nManagers noted that it was difficult to find the talent they needed in the \nmarketplace so when they did, they paid a little more. Even when doing more with \nless is the rule rather than the exception, hiring and maintaining outstanding talent is \nstill the most critical issue for every organization. \nIn year 2009, NY organizations also reported the following: \n39% laid-off staff; 61% did not lay off any staff \n50% froze salaries; 50% offered slight pay increases where appropriate \n22% reduced benefits; 78% continued benefits as is  \n19% reduced programs; 81% continued to provide all programs & services \n24% hired staff to fill critical vacancies \nTemps now represent a large portion of overall employment.  It has become \nimpossible to work without a good reliable temp workforce to lean on. 3327 PNP SALARY SURVEY NY09:Layout 1  2/2/10  1:47 PM  Page 1\n\nASSOCIATIONS, EDUCATION & ARTS ORGANIZATIONS

PNP Washington, DC: \n1629 K Street, NW \nWashington, DC 20006 \n202.719.9600 (P) \n202.719.9601 (F) \nwww.nonprofitstaffing.com MYTHS & REALITIES \nIn 2010, managing human capital will be a top priority. As organizations position \nthemselves to compete for resources, hiring and retaining the best staff may be the \ndifference between an organization’s success or failure. \nMyth:  No need to worry about staff retention – no one is going anywhere. \nReality: High performing staff, a limited resource, is always hard to find.  Competition for \ntop talent between similar organizations is fierce.  Retaining the best staff is an ongoing \neffort that cannot be presumed.  \nMyth: Candidate rich market means that I will be able to find the talent I need. \nReality: As the economy continues to improve, pent up demand for top performers will \nprevail and the best candidates will be hired quickly.  There are never enough high \nperformers in the marketplace.    \nMyth: Keeping salaries low is expected in this economy. \nReality: Retaining top staff requires that salaries remain competitive within the sector or \nyour best staff will leave to another organization where salaries are higher.  If you lose \ngood staff, the cost to your organization is enormous.    \nMyth: Putting off hiring key staff will save us money. \nReality: The truth is that putting off hiring the staff you need only postpones programs \nand services and promotes missed opportunities to hire incredible employees.  If you wait \ntoo long, someone else will hire the best staff and not you.    \nMyth: Doubling up on jobs is an efficient way to get through the year. \nReality: One of the most inefficient ways to run an organization is to double up on jobs \nproducing poor work, low morale, and a very tired team.  \nMyth: Staffing contracts are only for very large organizations that hire many temps. \nReality: Low cost contracts are available to both large and small organizations regardless \nof the number of temps needed by an organization. \nMyth: There is no way to reduce risk when hiring a new employee.   \nReality:  PNP’s one year guarantee on any Direct Hire placement reduces the risk you \ntake when hiring a new employee.  \nMyth: Finding an Interim Executive is difficult, time consuming, and not essential.   \nReality:  An organization’s ability to function well is impacted when major transitions \noccur.  Having the right Interim Executive can make that transition smooth and \nproductive, and PNP’s roster of available executives makes it easy. \nWe thank Ventureneer/Stengel Solutions for producing our survey.  ABOUT PNP \nAn expert in the unique staffing needs of \nnonprofits, PNP is the only recruiting firm \nproviding a full array of staffing services \nexclusively to the sector. \nWith our vast network of experienced job \nseekers and our rigorous screening \nprocess, we deliver results by finding the \nright hiring fit for every search.  \nPNP offers executive leaders and middle \nmanagers and support staff in: \n•  Fundraising \n•  Marketing \n•  Finance \n•  Human Resources \n•  Programs \n•  Information T echnology \n•  Administration and Office Support \nTEMP SERVICES \n•  Temps – hourly, day of, and long term \n•  Interim Execs – leaders and managers \nfor smooth transitions \n•  Temps to Hire – reduce hiring risks \n•  Consultants – specialized expertise \nDIRECT HIRE SERVICES \n•  Direct Hires – contingency searches \nwith one year guarantees \n•  Fast Tracks – low cost search options \nMANAGED STAFFING \n•  Payroll Services – add employees \nto PNP’s payroll and reduce costs \n•  Contract Services – customized \nagreements for the most cost efficient \nstaffing solutions 3327 PNP SALARY SURVEY NY09:Layout 1  2/2/10  1:47 PM  Page 4"

          "text": "Sundry items for The Clear Fund aka GiveWell (August 18, 2014 Board meeting)   I. Proposed amendment to bylaws  Amendment 6 - Authority to sign checks and notes  Amendment 1 is amended to read as follows. (Changes from the original text are underlined.)  The Executive Director shall be authorized to sign checks, drafts, promissory notes, orders for the payment of money, and other evidence of indebtedness of the corporation, provided that the amount signed for does not exceed $25,000 for any given signing.   All expenses of the Clear Fund must be approved by the Board of Directors either in advance or after they are incurred. The Executive Director shall be accountable for all expenses incurred, and must submit all such expenses for Board approval within a year of incurring them; the Executive Director is fully liable for any unapproved expenses that he or she incurs.  II. The rest of this document contains formalities, items that the board is required to review on an annual basis.  Review of compensation arrangements and benefits; partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations  Our bylaws state:  To ensure the corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:   a. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's-length bargaining.   b. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to the corporation's written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes, and do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit, or in an excess benefit transaction.  We maintain that • Compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's-length bargaining. \n\n• We have no noteworthy partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations.  Roster of Officers and Directors. A roster of GiveWell's Officers and Directors follows.  Elie Hassenfeld  Greg Jensen  Holden Karnofsky - Secretary  Tim Ogden - Vice-Chair  Rob Reich  Tom Rutledge - Chair  Brigid Slipka  Phil Steinmeyer  Cari Tuna - Treasurer  Mission and vision statements  Our mission: we find outstanding giving opportunities and publish the full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give.  Our vision: a world in which donors reward effectiveness in improving lives.   Review of insurance coverage  We currently have coverage for Directors & Officer Liability, Employment Practices, Internet Liability, Professional Liability, General Liability, and Property through Philadelphia Insurance Companies.    Our internal procedures state that we will annually review the need for each of the following types of insurance.  I have included notes with each.  • Director and Officers liability.  We are covered. • General liability. We are covered. \n\n• Business travel (can protect against lost property, reimburse for canceled flights, cover health expenses while traveling, etc.1).  We have limited general coverage. We have purchased trip-specific insurance in the past. • Fire/theft.  We have minimal Property insurance.  In addition, all important records, as well as weekly backups of all of our website content are saved to a secondary, off-site server and periodic (at least once per month) backups are maintained electronically on our personal computers and backed up in real-time to a remote server via the Carbonite service. • Employee dishonesty (theft/embezzlement2).  We are not covered. • Hired and non-owned auto.  We are not covered. • Professional Liability (\"protects professional practitioners such as Architects, quantity surveyors, home inspectors, Lawyers, physicians, and Accountants against potential negligence claims made by their patients/clients.\")3  We are covered. • Employment practices.  We are covered. • Workplace violence. We are covered. (This has been added since last insurance review.) • Business interruption.  We are only covered for certain expenses in limited situations. • Hurricane/flood.  See \"Fire/theft\" above.     \n                                                1 http://www.life123.com/career-money/career-development/business-travel/do-you-need-business-travel-insurance.shtml accessed 2/27/2010 2 http://www.naplia.com/employeedishonesty/index.shtml 3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_liability_insurance accessed 2/27/2010 "

Record retention  Clear Fund’s records are retained, in either electronic or paper format,  according to the schedule below, in compliance with government, legal, and funders’ requirements. When there is a conflict between federal, state and local record retention requirements, the longer retention period prevails. Certain important records, as determined by the Board, will be retained permanently, even if their retention is not required by law.  Record destruction  Once the retention period has expired, The Clear Fund may destroy the records in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of its contents. The Board of Directors approves all destruction of records prior to commencement.  Record destruction is performed under the direction of the Executive Director, who is responsible for maintaining all Certificates of Destruction.  Upon receipt of any legal notice, all record destruction will cease until the end of the investigation, if any.

ile: $7.3 million, 75 th percentile: $13 million). This is substantially larger than GiveWell's operating budget, though consistent with a budget that includes our money moved.   The median total compensation for this group is $144,000 (25 th /75 th percentile of $118,000/167,000). Adjusted for the cost​­of­​living in San Francisco, it is $170,000 ($123,000/$199,000).   Details of this data are available ​here​.  Compensation proposal   We propose a salary raise for Holden and Elie from $130,000 to $150,000/year. In addition to salary, GiveWell covers health benefits for employees and their families, which is approximately $5,000​/year per employee. "

Record retention  Clear Fund’s records are retained, in either electronic or paper format,  according to the schedule below, in compliance with government, legal, and funders’ requirements. When there is a conflict between federal, state and local record retention requirements, the longer retention period prevails. Certain important records, as determined by the Board, will be retained permanently, even if their retention is not required by law.  Record destruction  Once the retention period has expired, The Clear Fund may destroy the records in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of its contents. The Board of Directors approves all destruction of records prior to commencement.  Record destruction is performed under the direction of the Executive Director, who is responsible for maintaining all Certificates of Destruction.  Upon receipt of any legal notice, all record destruction will cease until the end of the investigation, if any.  Review of policy  Record retention requirements are reviewed annually with the Board and independent auditors to determine any necessary changes.

$136,761  $159,186  $180,535 \n \nNotes: \n \n●We have not adjusted for cost­of­living; these five organizations are all headquartered in \ncities in the Northeast and Mid­Atlantic regions. \n●The categorizations required some judgement calls. In particular, we excluded positions \nwith “finance” or “technology” in their name in case technical skills are a major part of \ntheir value. For example, we excluded the GobalGiving Foundation’s “COO & CFO”, and \nincluded their “Chief Business Officer” in the COO category instead. \n●Details of this data are available ​here​. \n \n \nAcademics  \n \nWe think that professors at UC ​Berkeley make for good comparisons because Berkeley is a well​ \nregarded school (and therefore ought to give some indication of what sort of pay attracts top ​tier \nintellectuals in a not​­for­profit environment), is public (so salary information is publicly available), \nand is located in the Bay Area.  \n \n\nWe believe that economics professors make the most appropriate comparison for Holden and \nElie within this data set.  \n \nIn 2013, we found three professors who had received their BAs during or after 2003 (the year \nHolden graduated from college). The total 2011 compensation for these professors was $119K \n(BA in 2008), 121K (BA in 2005), and $174K (BA in 2004). Note that professors typically have \n~3 months per year, and ~1 day per week during the remaining months, for pursuing side \nengagements, including paid ones. Holden and Elie work full­​time at GiveWell. \n \nDetails of this data are available ​here​. \n \nSocial Entrepreneurs \n \nIn late 2013, we reviewed the compensation of key staff (i.e., Chief Executives and other staff \nlisted on form 990s) at other mid­​stage “social entrepreneur”​­led organizations including Center \nfor Effective Philanthropy, Benetech, Kiva, Root Capital, Water for People and VisionSpring.  \n \nThe comparability of these organizations is a substantial judgment call. The median budget size \nfor the organizations we looked at was $10.1 million (25 th percentile: $7.3 million, 75 th \npercentile: $13 million). This is substantially larger than GiveWell's operating budget, though \nconsistent with a budget that includes our money moved.  \n \nThe median total compensation for this group is $144,000 (25 th /75 th percentile of \n$118,000/167,000). Adjusted for the cost​­of­​living in San Francisco, it is $170,000 \n($123,000/$199,000).  \n \nDetails of this data are available ​here​. \n \nCompensation proposal  \n \nWe propose a salary raise for Holden and Elie from $150,000 to $175,000/year. In addition to \nsalary, GiveWell covers health benefits for employees and their families, which is approximately \n$5,000​/year per employee. "

The primary ways we'll have significant impact in the future are by (a) recommending the best giving opportunities we can identify in the area of global health and development and (b) attracting as much funding as possible to those recommendations. 2. It is crucial that GiveWell identify and recommend new giving opportunities.  a. Without new recommendations, we believe that GiveWell would eventually only recommend GiveDirectly (because we believe that, eventually, there is unlikely to be significant room for more funding for deworming and bednets). b. This would cause us to lose existing donors and make it harder to attract new donors, and I believe we can increase our impact by identifying giving opportunities that have more impact per dollar given than GiveDirectly. 3. We intend to find new top charities via (a) work consistent with what we've done historically, (b) additional, specialized hires that will allow us to consider new areas within global health and development (e.g, education, agriculture), and (c) recommending grants (to Good Ventures, Open Philanthropy or others) to support the development of future GiveWell top charities.  4. With new recommendations we will have impact by (a) retaining the donors we have, (b) continuing to attract new donors, and (c) directing that funding to higher impact opportunities than we otherwise would. 5. Operationally: a. We need to increase our focus on strengthening our operations so that we are able to conduct the work above efficiently, effectively and without distraction. We plan to focus on on risk management, donations (and donations processing technology) and back-office operations. b. The Open Philanthropy/GiveWell split will not meaningfully affect GiveWell's funding situation. We are in a stable funding position supported by a diverse set of funders, and we plan to maintain our current approach to budgeting and fundraising. \n\n5) Other topics/questions from the Board  ● Explaining the split to the public "

          "text": " \nError! Unknown document property name.  Minutes for the March 27, 2017 Meeting of The Clear Fund ( dba Givewell)  \nBoard of Directors  \n \nA meeting of the Board of Directors (Board) of The Clear Fund dba GiveWell (GiveWell) was \nheld on March 27, 2017 at 4:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, at the offices of GiveW ell in San \nFrancisco, CA .  Notice was duly and timely given to each member of the Bo ard. \n \nThe following members of the Board were present:  \n Jake Gibson  \n Elie Hassenfeld  \n Holden Karnofsky  \n Timothy Ogden  \n Rob Reich  \n Tom Rutledge  \n Brigid Slipka  \n Phil Steinmeyer (by conference call ) \n Cari Tuna (by conference call ) \n Julia Wise  \n \nThe following individuals were also present:  \n Sarah Ward , Director of Operations, GiveWell  \n Alexander Berger , Open Philanthropy Project LLC  \n Celia Roady , Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP  \n Kimberly Eney , Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP (by conference call)  \n \nTom Rutledg e called the meeting to order, and Sarah Ward presented the agenda . Sarah  noted  \nthat some  Board  members have conflicts  regarding certain items on the agenda, and that those \nmembers will respond to questions and  then leave the room and/or get off the conference line \nwhile the Board engages in deliberation s and voting  on related matters . \n \nOpen Philanthropy Project Split  \n \nTimothy Ogden, Chair of the Open Philanthropy Project Split Subcommittee, updated the Board \non the status of the transfer of the Open Philanthropy Project (Project) to the Open \nPhilanthropy Project LLC (LLC) and reviewed the Subcommittee’s process for considering the  \ntransfer . Tim explained that the Subcommittee hired an independent accounting firm  to \ncomplete a valuation of the assets t hat would be transferred to the LLC.  The Subcommittee also \nengaged Morgan, Lewis & Bockius  LLP to provide legal advice to GiveWell regarding various \naspects of the transaction .  \n \nCelia Roady explained the legal c onsiderations associated with the tran sfer of the Project to the \nLLC, including the relevant requirements under the federal tax laws and state nonprofit \ncorporation law .  \n \nMembers of the Board involved with the LLC disclosed their conflicts. Holden Karnofsky  noted \nthat he  will become a full -time e mployee of the LLC, and Cari Tuna noted that she and her \nhusband, Dustin Moskovitz, expect to be the funders of the LLC. Elie Hassenfeld  will bill some of \nhis time  (initially, approximately 25%)  to the LL C while remaining employe d by GiveWell .  \n\n \n2 Cari, Holden and Elie all anticipate being on the board of the LLC although that has not been \nfinalized. Cari, Holden and Elie confirmed that they will leave the meeting for the Board’s \ndeliberation.   \n \nElie discussed the anticipated impact to GiveWell of the transfer of the Project  to the LLC. He \nnoted that the transfer will enable GiveWell to focus on its core mission and draw clearer \ndistinctions between the activities of GiveWell and the activities of the Project through separate \nbrands, staff, and fund raising. Based on conversations with donors , he indicated that the \ntransfer should have no material impact on GiveWell’s fundraising opportunities  beyond the \nremoval of Good Ventures support for the Project itself . Although s ome GiveWell donors are \nmore interested in supporting the activities of the Project than the activities of GiveWell, this is \nthe exception rather than the rule.  \n \nThe Board discussed possible alternatives to the transfer of the Project to the LLC. Board \nmembe rs noted th at the Project is not income -producing and other purchasers are unlikely . \nBoard members also acknowledged that GiveWell employees who currently work on the Project \ncould always leave GiveWell and work for the LLC.  \n \nThe Board discussed the fact that GiveWe ll and the LLC will  enter into a cost -sharing \nagreement , which will enable GiveWell and the LLC to share services  of certain employees , such \nas operations and reception staff, and certain other expenses on a cost -reimbursement basis. \nBoard members confirmed that the LLC intends to compensate its employees in a similar \nmanner as GiveWell, even though the LLC is not subject to the restrictions applicable to Section \n501(c)(3) organizations.   \n \nThe Board asked Alexander, Holden, and Cari  to provide  information  about the LLC’s anticipated \nactivities. The y confirmed that the LLC does not expect to earn a  profit from commercial \nactivities or investments and that it does not intend for  the LLC’s employees to r eceive  equity or \nother forms of profit -sharing . The activities of the Project will continue to be conducted much \nlike they are conducted today . Cari noted that the Project will be defined under its own terms as \nopposed to as a collaboration between Good Ve ntures and GiveWell. The y also confirmed that \nthe LLC will not compete with Give Well with respect to fundraising. Cari  indicated that her \nintention is to have the sa me relationship with GiveWell that  she has now as a Board member \nand donor.  \n \nTim walked through the negotiation process  with the Board , including some recent changes to \nthe term shee t. He explained that at this meeting the Board needs to approve the overall \nframework for final negotiati ons regarding the term sheet. Celia reminded the B oard that the \nindependent valuation  report presents a range for the fair market value of the assets  that will \nbe transferred to the LLC , and that the Board should consider and rely on a valuation within this \nrange when setting a  price for the sale of asset s. The Board discussed the timing of the \ntransaction and the need to obtain confirmation of the LLC’s authorization of individuals to \nnegotiate on its behalf.   \n \nHolden, Elie, and Alexander left the room, and Cari got off the phone.  \n \nThe Board engaged in further deliberation and debate regarding the term sheet and the \nproposed transfer of the Project to the LLC , including the valuation process.  The Board \n\n \n3 members reiterated the fact that the  transfer of the Project involves a unique tr ansaction , and \nCelia confirmed that the Board can rely on the full range of the fair market valuations presented \nin the independent valuation  report.   \n \nUpon motion duly made and seconded, the non-conflicted members of the Board unanimously \napproved  the resolutions regarding Approval of Process for Negotiating Terms for Acquisition of \nOpen Philanthropy Project by Open Philanthropy Project LLC, which are set forth in Exhibit 1 .   \n \nHolden and Elie joined the meeting, and Cari returned by conference call .  \n \nModification to Excess Assets P olicy  \n \nThe Board members discussed the application of GiveWell’s  excess assets policy  to the funds \nreceived as a result of the transfer of the Project to the LLC . Sarah explained the policy, which \nrequires GiveWell to irrevoc ably earmark for GiveWell’ s recommended charities certain excess  \nrevenue at each budget meeting  of the Board . Tim noted that given an anticipated closing in \nMay and budget meeting in June, the Board will need more time to evaluate its future activities \nbefore applying the excess assets policy to the assets received as a result of the transfer of the \nProjec t. The Board engaged in some deliberation and debate regarding the p roposed revisions \nto the policy and agreed that more time will b e needed to develop a budget against which to \napply the policy to the sale proceeds.   \n \nUpon motion duly made and seconded, the Board unanimously approved the resolutions \nregarding Amendment of the Excess Assets Policy, which are set forth in Exhibit 2 .   \n \nChanging Threshold for Requiring Board Approval  of Expenses  \n \nThe Board discussed  modifying the threshold requirement for the Board’s approval of expenses \nof the organization  under the bylaws . Sarah detailed some of the logistical considerations \nassociated  with the current requirement of Board approval for expenses exceeding $25,000 . \nSarah worked with Morgan, Lewis & Bockius to identify expenses arising outside of the ordinary \ncourse of business as an alternative threshold for the Board’s approval of expenses. The Board \nengaged in some deliberation and debate regarding this proposal. As an alternative, the Board \nsettled on Audit Committee approval for unbudgeted expenses exceeding 3% of GiveWell’s \npreviously -Board approved budget. The Board discussed the fact that this year involved unique \ncircumstances associated with the possible spinout of the Project and decided to se t the \nrequirement at expenses exceeding $60,000 as an approximation until the upcoming  budget \nmeeting in June. In light of these new revisions, Elie requested that the Board approve up to \n$100,000 on the purchase of advertisements  and podcasts  through Vox.  \n \nUpon motion duly made and seconded, the Board unanimously approved  the resoluti ons \nregarding Board Approval of Expenses, which are set forth in Exhibit 3 .  \n \nRatification of the Creation of the Audit Subcommittee and the Strategy \nSubcommittee  \n \nSarah presented some background on the formation of the audit subcommittee and the \nstrategy subcommittee during the summer, and the need for the Board to formally vote to ratify \n\n \n4 the formation of these subcommittees. Upon motion duly made and seconded, the Board \nunanimousl y approved resolutions regarding ratification of the c reation of the Audit \nSubcommittee , which are set forth in Exhibit 4 . The Board also approved resolutions regarding \nthe ratification of the creation of the Strategy Subcommittee, as set forth in Exhibit 4, with \nHolden and Cari abstaining from the vote.  \n \nAdjournment  \n \nMr. Rutledge  thanked all participants for the discussion. There being no further business to \ncome before the Board, the meeting was duly adjourned  at 6:00 pm Pacific Standard Time . \n     \n \n  \n\n \n5 Exhibit 1  \n \nAPPROVAL OF PROCESS FOR NEGOTIATING TERMS FOR ACQUISITION OF OPEN \nPHILANTHROPY PROJECT BY OPEN PHILANTHROPY PROJECT LLC  \n \nWHEREAS, The Clear Fund d/b/a GiveWell (“GiveWell”) is an organization exempt from federal \nincome tax under Section 501(c)(3 ) of the Internal Revenue Code;

Our \"conservative scenario\" projection is $3.4 million.   \n  \n We project the following sources of revenue:  \n  \n 1. Good Ventures ​  has in the last few years supported GiveWell at 20% of its operating  \n expenses. A portion of this gift is in the form of in-kind office space. Total: ​ $0.75 million ​ .   \n 2. A ​ private individual ​  has made large unrestricted gifts to GiveWell. In past years, we  \n have used a portion of the gift, set to 10% of operating expenses, for operating costs,  \n and granted the remainder to top charities. The goal was to limit dependence on a single  \n donor where we didn't have a strong expectation of future giving. We now believe that  \n their is a high likelihood that the donor will support GiveWell at a similar level in future  \n years. We are now proposing to retain 20% of the operating budget and grant out the  \n remainder to top charities. Total: ​ $0.75 million ​ .   \n 3. We are projecting that ​ donors giving less than $10,000 ​  will in aggregate give ​ $1.09  \n million ​ , up from $0.8 million in 2016. The projection for 2017 is considerably higher than  \n 2016 actual because $0.36 million was received from this group of donors in the first  \n quarter of 2017.  1\n 1  The 2017 projected total includes actuals for Q1 and, for the remainder of the year, projects 10% growth  \n over the total from donors giving less than $10,000 in 2016. Growth in this category was about 10% in  \n 2016 over 2015; in the two years prior to that it was ~40% growth per year. 10% growth in 2017 is likely  \n conservative given strong growth in Q1.  \n\n4. We are projecting ​  $1.46 million ​  from ​ donors giving over $10,000 ​ , compared with  \n $1.55 million in 2016.   2\n  \n The conservative projection excludes:  \n 1. Donors who have given $10,000 before but have not given consistently or who we have  \n reason to believe may not give again. (In the main projection, these donor's past giving  \n is discounted for expected value based on past experience.)  \n 2. Revenue from new major donors (those giving over $10,000 who have not given at this  \n level before).   \n 3. Half of projection of funding from donors giving less than $10,000.  \n Assets  \n  \n Balance of unrestricted funds, end of 2016: $4.66 million  \n Estimated balance of unrestricted funds, end of April 2017: $5.31 million (of which, we are  \n proposing to restrict $0.96 million—see above). This estimate has not been confirmed by our  \n accountants.   \n Projected revenue excluded from this document  \n  \n The above does not include:  \n 1. Funding from Good Ventures for 2017 GiveWell budget. We plan to submit a request for  \n $0.53 million after the board has approved the budget.  \n 2. Funding from Good Ventures to cover Open Philanthropy Project expenses between  \n when the last grant ended at the end September 2016 and the Open Phil spin-off on  \n June 1, 2017. Good Ventures has not committed to making such a grant, but we believe  \n it will do so. We will have a precise figure after we close our books for May; we currently  \n anticipate that this request will be between $2 and $3 million.  \n 3. Proceeds from the sale of assets to Open Philanthropy Project LLC ($2.65 million).  \n Funds were received on May 31.  \n Excess assets policy  \n  \n With current projections, ​ our excess assets policy ​  is not triggered. The policy may be triggered  \n after accounting for the sale of assets to Open Philanthropy Project LLC and if GiveWell  \n 2  The projection includes both (a) analysis of individual donors' past giving and an expected value of  \n future given based on past patterns of donor attrition (as well as actual giving in Q1), and (b) a projection  \n of giving from new donors (or, more specifically, donors who have not given a major unrestricted gift to  \n GiveWell before). Part (b) incorporates actual giving in Q1 and, for the remainder of the year, an average  \n of new major giving in 2014-2016.

Elie currently receives no non-salary compensation from GiveWell.  \n  \n Foundations   \n  \n We have private data from a 2016 survey of 131 foundations by Lasnik- ​ Broida Consultants, Inc.  \n in collaboration with The Croner Company. Below is aggregate information about total  \n compensation for CEOs among foundations with 16-50 employees.  \n  \n CEO Compensation at Foundations with 16-50 employees   \n (n = 52)  \n  25th percentile  50th percentile  75th percentile  \n Base pay  $378,000  $427,500  $529,900  \n Total  \n compensation  $449,000  $504,900  $649,600  \n  \n And here is the aggregate information about total compensation for CEOs among foundations  \n with more than $1.5 billion in assets.  \n  \n CEO Compensation at Foundations with more than $1.5 billion in assets  \n (n = 36, overlaps with above)  \n  25th percentile  50th percentile  75th percentile  \n Base pay  $561,000  $671,500  $763,100  \n Total  \n compensation  $675,600  $781,100  $981,500  \n  \n Notes:   \n  \n\n● These data are not adjusted for cost- ​ of- ​ living, although most of the foundations are  \n based in large American cities.  \n ● The 36 foundations surveyed with $1.5 billion in assets or more had a median grants  \n payout of $124 million. GiveWell's estimate of 2016 money moved is slightly more than  \n $100 million (approximately $92 million to top charities and $10 million to GiveWell  \n Incubation Grants.)  1\n ● Details of this data and definitions are available in Exhibit A.  \n  \n Research not-for-profits  \n  \n We pulled the available staff compensation information from eight research or  \n charity-review-oriented not-for-profits: Innovations for Poverty Action, IDinsight, Evidence  \n Action, Center for Global Development, Center for Effective Philanthropy, Urban Institute,  \n Guidestar, and Charity Navigator.  \n  \n Here are the summary statistics for the salaries of the president, CEO, or Executive Director at  \n those organizations in their 2015 990s:  \n  \n Compensation for Presidents and/or CEOs at 8 orgs from 2015 990s  \n  25th percentile  50th percentile  75th percentile  \n Base pay  $163,350  $221,091  $331,952  \n Total compensation  $190,701  $231,317  $426,458  \n  \n Notes:  \n ● We have not adjusted for cost ​ -of- ​ living.  \n ● The categorizations required some judgement calls. In particular, both Evidence Action  \n and Charity Navigator experienced executive turnover in 2015. We prorated the salaries  \n for both Evidence Action executive directors over one calendar year. Charity Navigator’s  \n second CEO in 2015 did not receive a salary in 2015 and we excluded him from the  \n dataset.  \n ● Details of this data are available in Exhibit B.  \n  \n Academics   \n  \n We think that professors at UC Berkeley make for good comparisons because Berkeley is a well  \n regarded school (and therefore ought to give some indication of what sort of pay attracts top tier  \n intellectuals in a not ​ for ​ profit environment), is public (so salary information is publicly available),  \n and is located in the Bay Area.  \n 1  We chose this tier because it was the closest to GiveWell's money moved. The next tier down in the  \n compensation survey we relied on had a median annual grants payout of $32 million.  \n\n \n We believe that economics professors make the most appropriate comparison for Elie within this  \n data set.  \n  \n Below are summary statistics for the compensation of Berkeley economics professors in 2014.  \n  \n  \n Compensation for UC Berkeley economics professors in 2014   \n (n = 41)  \n  25th percentile  50th percentile  75th percentile  \n Base pay  $143,450  $226,392  $269,833  \n Total compensation  $183,550  $264,414  $336,367  \n   \n  \n We found six professors who had received their BAs in 2004 or later (the year Elie  \n graduated from college). The total compensation for each of these professors was $57K (BA in  \n 2009),  $159K (BA in 2008), $153K (BA in 2006), $184K (BA In 2005), $169K (BA in 2004), and  2\n $227K (BA in 2004). Note that professors typically have ~3 months per year, and ~1 day per  \n week during the remaining months, for pursuing side engagements, including paid ones. Elie  \n works full ​ -time at GiveWell.  \n  \n Details of this data are available in Exhibit B.  \n  \n Compensation proposal  \n  \n We propose a compensation raise for Elie from $175,000 to $200,000 per year. Elie currently  \n receives no non-salary compensation from GiveWell.  \n  \n 2  ​ We suspect that this professor may not have been employed by Berkeley for the entire 2014 calendar  \n year. His CV just indicates that he started in 2014: ​ http://philippstrack.com/files/StrackCVMar2015.pdf  "

          "text": " \n What are GiveWell's major priorities over the next 3 -5 years?  \n \nThis document lists our major priorities by functional area: research, operations, and outreach.  \n \nResearch  \n \nThe success GiveWell has had to date has been due to the quality of our research, so the items \nbelow are crucial to our continued success.  \n \n1. Maintain and improve our product . Among other things, this means that we will continue to \n(a) update our views on our current to p charities, (b) look for and find new top charities and \ninterventions, (c) revise and improve our cost -effectiveness analysis, (d) through GiveWell \nIncubation Grants, continue to identify opportunities to generate more top charity contenders \nby funding re search, start -up charities and improved monitoring all while maintaining the \nsame level of transparency that we have to date.  \na. As part of maintaining the quality of GiveWell's recommendations, we plan to formally \nrevisit the focus on global health and deve lopment (GH&D). GiveWell chose to focus \non GH&D because our early research (2007 -2010) convinced us that GH&D offered \nthe best giving opportunities that met our criteria. However, at its core, GiveWell is \nnot focused on GH&D; we're focused on the best givi ng opportunities that are \nevidence -backed, cost -effective and have room for more funding. While our \nexpectation is that revisiting this decision will lead us to maintain our focus on GH&D, \nwe plan to revisit this decision. The points below assume that we c ontinue to focus \non GH&D.  \n2. Comprehensively survey program areas in GH&D and have compelling answers for \nwhy we recommend the programs we do, and why we don't recommend others.  \nGiveWell has looked at many programs, but there remain many that we haven't exami ned in \ndepth. For example, we would like to have a more systematic view of education, agriculture, \nreproductive health, and surgical interventions. There are also more general areas we \nhaven't formally evaluated such as health systems strengthening and dis ease elimination or \neradication programs. We plan to do research that allows us to assess these programs and \neither make them priority programs (and seek out charities that implement them) or formally \nexplain why we do not believe they are promising.  \na. This may also include approaches to GH&D that go beyond direct program delivery. \nFor example, philanthropy that aims to improve tobacco or road safety regulations \nglobally to improve health and reduce disability. As has been the case, such \nprograms would need t o be evidence -backed, cost -effective, and scalable to be \npriority programs.  \n3. All charities that should be top charities are top charities . Currently, we may not \nrecommend some charities for reasons including (a) they misunderstand us, our value -\nadded, or ou r process so they don't apply, (b) we haven't completed the work to assess the \nevidence for the intervention they implement (see the bullet above), or (c) we have limited \ncapacity and have prioritized our work such that we haven't yet been able to review s ome \npromising organizations. GiveWell should eventually overcome this hurdle and should be \nconfident that all charities that exist that would meet our criteria are recommended.  \n\n \n 4. GiveWell has created the mechanism and incentive for people to start organizati ons \nthat could meet our criteria.  Taken together, we believe that the work laid out above will \ncreate the incentive for people to try to create high -impact nonprofits that meet our criteria \nbecause we can offer (a) financial support to people who want to s tart an organization, \nconduct early stage research or add M&E to a program they're already running through the \nGiveWell Incubation Grants program, (b) predictable criteria to determine whether or not an \norganization will be recommended, and (c) significant  funding if the organization succeeds.  \n \nThis is important because other than GiveWell we believe that these incentives are not \nnearly strong enough. GiveWell is uniquely positioned because we can offer both early stage \nfinancial support but also significa nt funding to groups at scale. We believe that creating a \nstrong incentive for people to create high -impact organizations is a way through which we \ncould have significant long -term impact beyond the funding we move directly to our \nrecommendations.  \n \n \nOutreach  \n \nWe have historically put limited time into proactive outreach and have consistently treated \nresearch as a higher organizational priority. Given the quality of our research, we now believe \nthat outreach is at a similar priority level to research a nd we anticipate allocating significant \ncapacity to it in the future.  \n \n1. We aim to significantly increase our money moved . Specifically, our non -Good Ventures \nmoney moved is currently approximately $40 million annually. We aim to increase that figure \nto $100  million annually. We do not have specific goals for whether this comes from one (or \nrelatively few) major donor(s) or a large number of smaller donors: our focus is on the \namount of funding we direct.  \na. In 2016, Good Ventures gave approximately $60 million to our recommendations \n($50 million to top charities and $10 million to GiveWell Incubation Grants). We \nexpect this funding to continue.  \n \nOperations / organizational goals  \n \nBefore mid -2016, we treated operations as a low priority, and we have a lot of work  to do to improve \nit. It is important that we get to a situation where:  \n \n1. GiveWell has high -quality operations . Our operations infrastructure, including our work in \ndonations processing, finance, legal, HR, tech, and office management, is high -quality and \ncan support our research and outreach goals.   \n2. GiveWell is a robust organization whose success does not rely on any one individual. \nFor all staff members, we have a contingency plan and ability to thrive if we lose any \nindividual.  "

Minutes for the April 25 , 2017 Meeting of The Clear Fund ( dba GiveW ell) \nBoard of Directors  \n \nA meeting of the Board of Directors (Board) of The Clear Fund dba GiveWell (GiveWell) was \nheld on April 25, 2017 at 3:30  p.m. Pacific Standard Time, by conference call .  Directors not in \nattendance waived notice of the meeting.  \n \nThe following members of t he Board were present  (by conference call) :  \n Jake Gibson  \n Greg Jensen  \n Timothy Ogden  \n Rob Reich  \n Tom Rutledge  \n Brigid Slipka  \n Phil Steinmeyer  \n Julia Wise  \n \nThe following individuals were also present  (by conference call) :  \n Sarah Ward , Director of Operations, GiveWell  \n Celia Roady, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP  \n \nTom Rutledge called the meeting to order, and Sarah Ward presented the agenda .  \n \nApproval of Minutes for the March 27, 2017 Meeting  \n \nUpon motion duly made and seconded, the Board approved the Minutes for the March 27, 2017 \nMeeting of the Clear Fund (dba GiveWell) Board of Directors.  \n \nOpen Philanthropy Project Split  \n \nTimothy Ogden, Chair of the Open Philanthropy Project Split Subcommittee, updated the Board \non the status o f the proposed transfer of the Open Philanthropy Project (Project) to the Open \nPhilanthropy Project LLC (LLC) and reviewed the Subcommittee’s process for considering the  \ntransfer . Tim explained that the Subcommittee received documentation of the LLC’s \nauthorization of Rakesh Mehta and Alexander Berger to negotiate, on behalf of the LLC, the \nterms and conditions of the transfer. Tim also explained that the Subcommittee received a non -\nbinding statement from the LLC about its intended future governance plans.   \n \nTim pointed the Board to the term sheet (“Term Sheet”), which reflects the Subcommittee’s \nfinal negotiations with the LLC regarding the major terms of the transfer of the Project to the \nLLC. Tim also reminded the Board that the Subcommittee hired an independent accounting firm  \nto complete a valuation of the assets that would be transferred to the LLC. Tim walked through \nthe methodologies employed by the independent accounting firm  to estimate a  fair ma rket \nvalue range  for the assets contemplated to be transferred to the LLC .  \n \nTim walked the Board through the other terms in the Term Sheet. He explained that the \nSubcommittee wanted to ensure that the LLC would be willing to license certain IP created in \nconnection with the Project to GiveWell  so it can post information on its website for historical \n\n \n2 \n purposes and use other IP for future projects.  Tim noted proposed terms for the allocation of \nrisks and liabilities  between GiveWell and the LLC. Tim also mentioned the terms governing the \ntransfer of Project grant agreements  and certain other contracts from GiveWell to the LLC , \ntransition issues related to employees and contractors , spinoff transaction costs, the cost -\nsharing agreement between the parties, and future profit-sharing (under which the LLC will \nagree to donate any profits it realizes from certain commercial activities or investments during \nits first three fiscal years to GiveWell recommended charities).  \n \nThe Board engaged in further de liberation and debate regarding the Term S heet and the \nproposed transfer of the Project to the LLC , including the valuation process.  The Board \nmembers reiterated the fact that the  transfer of the Project involves a unique transaction  and \nthat the Board can  rely on the full range of the fair market valuations presented in the \nindependent valuation  report.   \n \nRob Reich, a member of the Subcommittee, noted that he believes the transaction to be in \nGiveWell’s  best interests relative to alternatives, including the possibility of GiveWell staff \nmembers separating  from GiveWell and joining the LLC  (independent of any transaction to sell \nthe Project assets to the LLC ). Rob stated  that he thinks separating the Project from GiveWell \nwill allow  GiveWell to focus on its original mission.  \n \nTom Rutledge asked the Board members to raise any concerns they may have about the \nproposed transaction or the terms set forth in the Term Sheet. The Board raised no concerns.  \n \nUpon motion duly made and seconded, the members of the Board present (none of which had a \nconflict of interest) unanimously approved  the resolutions regarding Approval of the Open \nPhilanthropy Project Split, which are set forth in Exhibit 1 .   \n \nThe Subcommittee mentioned that it is hoping to close the Open Philanthropy Project split \ntransaction by  May 31, 2017.  \n \nThe Board members discussed the agenda for the June 6, 2017 Board meeting, which  the \nBoard agreed will include further  discussion of Gi veWell’s future after the spinoff of the Project.  \n \n \nAdjournment  \n \nTim thanked all participants for the discussion. There being no further business to come before \nthe Board, the meeting was duly adjourned  at 4:30 pm Pacific Standard Time . \n     \n \n    \n \n  \n\n \n3 \n Exhibit 1  \n \nAPPROVAL OF THE OPEN PHILANTHROPY PROJECT SPLIT  \n \nWHEREAS, The Clear Fund d/b/a GiveWell (“GiveWell”) is an organization exempt from federal \nincome tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;  \n \nWHEREAS, GiveWell has operated the Open  Philanthropy Project (“Project”) as one of its \nprograms to give effectively and share its findings openly so that anyone can build on its work;  \n \nWHEREAS, GiveWell received a request from the Open Philanthropy Project LLC (“LLC”) to \npurchase the assets of the Project for no less than the fair market value of such assets;  \n \nWHEREAS, the LLC was established to, among other things, support a range of philanthropic \nendeavors;  \n \nWHEREAS, the Board established the GiveWell, Open Philanthropy Split Subcommittee \n(“Subcommittee”) as an independent committee of the Board to evaluate the potential sale of \nthe Project to the LLC and to report on the considerations regarding such a sale to the Board;  \n \nWHEREAS, at the meeting of the Board on March 27, 2017, the Subcommi ttee reported to the \nBoard on the considerations involved in the sale of the Project to the LLC, and the Board \nevaluated these and additional considerations, including the alternatives to such a sale and any \nmore advantageous arrangements, the Board’s fidu ciary obligations, and the findings of the \nvaluation report, dated March 17, 2017, from an independent expert regarding the fair market \nvalue of the assets of the Project (“Valuation”); and  \n \nWHEREAS, the Board authorized Timothy Ogden and Rob Reich to ente r into negotiations with \nthe LLC regarding the terms associated with the sale of the Project to the LLC, and such parties \nhave entered into final negotiations regarding these terms, as reflected in the term sheet set \nforth on Attachment A  (“Term Sheet”).  \n \nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that, in reliance on the information set forth in the \nValuation, the independent members of the Board, acting without the presence of any \nconflicted members of the Board, hereby approve the sale of the Project to the LLC upo n the \nterms set forth in the Term Sheet, finding such a sale to be fair, reasonable, in the best \ninterests of GiveWell, and for GiveWell’s own benefit.  \n \nFURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board’s approval of the terms set forth in the Term Sheet shall \nbe contingen t on a final list of assets that reflects the scope of assets set forth in the valuation \nreport and any additional assets that have no ascertainable value.  \n \nFURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board hereby authorizes Timothy Ogden and any persons that \nTimothy Ogden  may designate (which shall be limited to Sarah Ward and any non -conflicted \nofficers of GiveWell) to negotiate the final details of the transaction and enter into agreements \nwith the LLC in accordance with the Term Sheet.  \n \n\n \n4 \n FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board hereby authorizes Timothy Ogden, Sarah Ward, and the \nnon-conflicted officers of GiveWell to do and perform all such further acts and to execute such \ndocuments as shall be necessary or advisable in order to carry out the foregoing resolutions.  \n "

Research : aimed at identifying outstanding giving opportunities and publish ing our \nreasoning  \n2. Outreach : aimed at increasing the amount of money that goes to our recommendations  \n3. Operations : aimed at supporting the above two goals via donation processing, HR, \nfinance and accounting, office management and legal.  \n \nBelow, this document discusses our top priorities in each domain in details. He re, we briefly \nsummar ize: \nResearch  \nOur research team is in good shape. Our team is able to effectively research and publish \nreports on the giving opportunities we want to consider. There are problems we need to fix but \nthe team has the capacity to make the  necessary changes. Adding additional capacity to the \nresearch team would allow us to move faster / do more, but it wouldn't change the types of \nresearch we're able to do.  \nOutreach  \nWe put limited capacity into outreach historically, and it has significant  room for improvement.  \n \nThe consistency of our outreach to major donors has improved significantly since we hired \nCatherine Hollander (our only staff member dedicated to outreach), but she's capacity \nconstrained: we don't reach out to as many donors as we ideally would.  \n \nIn addition, we have historically put limited effort into proactively increasing the amount of \nfunding we direct to our top charities. We see a major potential opportunity to increase our \nmoney moved with a thoughtful strategy.  \n \nDeveloping  a promising strategy for outreach that increases our money moved as much as \npossible is a top organizational priority.  \nOperations  \nWe're in the process of building an operations team led by Sarah Ward (Director of Operations). \nWe still have room for improv ement but the team effectively executes all its day -to-day \nresponsibilities, and if it continues on its current trajectory, will be significantly improved in the \nnear future.  \n\n \n Current Vision and Mission Statements  \n \nMission: GiveWell finds and supports the d evelopment of outstanding giving opportunities and \npublishes the full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give.  \n \nVision: a world in which donors reward charities for effectiveness in improving lives.  \nHow aligned is current state and curr ent operations to these statements? If not well aligned, do \nthey need review? Do priorities need to be realigned?  \nWith a small edit, the mission statement reflects what we're doing.  \n \nThe vision seems fine.  \nExecutive Leadership  \nName Elie’s Top 3 priorities /investment areas with goals/metrics and relative priority of each  \n \nThese are listed in order of priority:  \n \n1. Maximize the long term impact of staff, especially my reports.  \na. For my reports (Natalie, Josh, Sarah and Catherine):  \ni. Do this via coaching, assessment , mentorship, training focusing both in \ntheir project work and contributions and leadership/management \ndevelopment.  \nii. This includes working with them to set priorities and goals for them and \ntheir teams (when applicable) and checking in to ensure their acti ons are \nconsistent with agreed upon goals.  \niii. The goals / metrics varies by each person, so we should discuss what \nsorts of goals/metrics would be most useful. At a high level, in most \ncases, my goal is to expand the scope of what each person can do while \nlimiting the time I spend.  \nb. For the rest of staff:  \ni. Set culture and key improvements in culture/work environment. My \nassessment is that there are aspects of our culture/work environment we \nshould work to resolve, but that a relatively low intensity effort (i.e., being \naware of and diligent about improvements) will likely yield sufficient \nresults.  \nii. We recently retained a consultant to conduct interviews with all staff to \nidentify problems. That project led us to settle on two major improvements \nwe intend to a im to improve on. They are:  \n1. Responding to ideas and critiques. A core value of GiveWell's is \nthat we make decisions based on reason, logic, and evidence. It's \n\n \n clear from the feedback that staff perceive some decisions as \nbeing made suboptimally, with a bia s towards the status quo and \naway from new ideas.  \n2. Performance feedback. The way in which management, myself \nincluded, has communicated with many on staff about your \nperformance and trajectory has caused confusion, anxiety, \nuncertainty, and lack of motivati on. \niii. We don't believe we can easily track this quantitatively. Instead, we plan \nto qualitatively track this via:  \n1. Elie's meetings 1:1 with all staff. (I meet with everyone at GiveWell \nat least 1x/quarter.)  \n2. Manager s' 1:1s with direct reports. (Managers have 1 :1s with \nreports 1x/week.)  \n3. Incorporating questions about the above into exit interviews  \n4. Running a similar process to interview staff about problems next \nyear (~April 2018) to see whether we have made progress  \nc. Recruiting - low level since other staff lead m ost proactive efforts, but keep an \neye out for great people/other vendors we might be able to retain. This may \nbecome a higher priority if/when we aim to hire more senior staff (most likely in \noutreach).  \n2. Decisions I make and/or work I do directly (e.g., w eigh in on research conclusions, \nIDinsight relationship, GIG investigations, recruiting plans and decisions)  \na. I still spend a significant time leading research projects or weighing in on \ndecisions that aren't explicitly targeted at developing staff.  \nb. My goal here is to reduce the amount of time I spend on this bucket by working \non priority #1 above.  \n3. Develop a plan and lead long -term project to increase GW money moved  \na. We have a long -term goal of substantially increasing our money moved. We're \naiming to dev elop a more concrete plan for how we intend to accomplish this by \nthe end of the 3rd quarter of 2017.  \nb. Metrics:  \ni. Short -term: do we have a solid plan by the end of 3Q 2017  \nii. Long -term: does money moved reach $100m, ex -Good Ventures by \ngiving season 2022.  \n \nVery roughly speaking, I'd guess that, over the past 6 months, priority #1 above has accounted \nfor 60%, #2 30% of my time/attention, and #3 10% of my attention but I expect that #3 will \nincrease substantially over the next 6 months.  \nDiscuss relative priority/i nvestment in each of three major domains (research, operations, and \noutreach)  \n \nIn the first half of 2017, I spent ~60% of my GiveWell time on research, 20% on operations and \n20% on outreach. (I spent 88% of my work hours on GiveWell and 12% on Open Philant hropy.)  \n\n \n  \nI allocated the most time to research because it has historically been our top organizational \npriority, and my contributions have been necessary to move it forward as effectively as possible.  \n \nI expect that I'll devote more of my capacity to outreach in the future and continue to delegate \nas much research ownership as possible to Josh and Natalie so that I can focus on outreach. I \nexpect that my research hours fall and my outreach hours rise in the 2nd half of the year.  \n \nI don't think I'll all ocate more time and attention to operations. Sarah Ward is running that team \nand I think that that team will be successful without significantly more engagement from me; as \nSarah gets more experience, I expect the time I spend on operations to fall.  \nWhy do es this shift make sense?  \nOur research is our product, so it has to remain high quality. I also suspect, based to some \nextent on intuition and to some extent on my subjective impression of donors' reactions to our \nresearch between 2013 and 2015 when we did n't produce a large amount of new research, that \nour research has to continue to improve and push new frontiers to maintain donors' belief that \nGiveWell represents the gold standard for recommendations to donors.  \n \nOver the past 18 months, a few things have  changed:  \n1. Our research capacity has increased substantially as we've added some new staff and \nexisting staff have matured. Excluding me, our research staff is able to cover a lot of \nground and continue to push our research to explore new areas.  \n2. The room fo r more funding among our recommendations has surpassed our money \nmoved. Several years ago, we estimated moderate room for more funding among our \ntop charities, and we worried about the possibility of finding new charities with additional \nroom for more fund ing. This has changed. Our estimated room for more funding at our \ntop charities exceeded our money moved by more than $100 million last year, excluding \nGiveDirectly. In addition, GiveWell Incubation Grants are starting to generate larger \ngiving opportuniti es, and we've heard from top charities that some are nervous about our \ntotal funding capacity.  \n3. Good Ventures is unlikely to give much more than $60 million to our recommendations in \nthe near future. Previously, it seemed plausible that Good Ventures would decide to give \nsubstantially more to our recommendations.  \n \nAt the same time, we have made some progress on outreach by hiring Catherine, and our \nrelations with existing donors are in good shape. However, we have made virtually no effort \nraise additional fu nding. I don't think we currently have the capacity on staff to sufficiently push \noutreach forward, which requires determining our strategy and deciding who to hire, unless I \nfocus on it.  \n\n \n Research  \nName top 3 goals/metrics in research  \n \nThese are our four t op priorities, in order of importance:  \n \n1. Maintain our current product: follow and stay up -to-date on current top charities, \nstandouts and interventions; assess new charities and interventions that appear to be \npromising based on our current criteria and ass essment of interventions; release new \nrecommendations annually; maintain quality standards for research.  \na. Priority/time allocation: This is our core product offering (i.e., our annual release \nof new top charities). We have worked hard to limit the amount of  work that goes \ninto this to the minimum necessary. Currently, this work is led by Natalie \n(accounting for ~50% of her time). Natalie manages a team of 4 people, and I'd \nroughly estimate that 2/3 of their time is devoted to this goal. In addition, Josh \nspends a small amount of time (~10%) on intervention updates.  \nb. Metrics:  \ni. Do we stay up -to-date on our top charities and interventions and release \na high -quality update before December 1st?  \nii. How many new charities do we assess?  \niii. How many promising interventions do  we complete thorough reviews of?  \niv. How much capacity/time does it take to accomplish this goal, especially \nfocused on updating our views on top charities and top charities' \ninterventions?  \n2. Intervention prioritization: There are many interventions we haven't sufficiently assessed \nto have compelling reasons to not prioritize. This work aims to more systematically follow \nand assess interventions that could lead to top charities.  \na. Metrics:  \ni. How many new interventions do we assess at a shallow and medium \nlevel?  \nii. How promising do these interventions appear to be as measured by (a) \nestimated cost -effectiveness and (b) plausibility as GiveWell top \ncharities?  \niii. Does this work lead to new top charities or new Incubation Grants?  \n3. Build for the future: work we do today that won 't lead to significant impacts in the next 1 -\n2 years but we expect to have longer -term benefits. This is mostly (a) ongoing recruiting \nefforts and (b) work on GiveWell Incubation Grants.  \na. Metrics:  \ni. Do our recruiting efforts lead to hires that contribute sign ificantly to \nGiveWell's research?  \n1. [Redaction]  \nii. Do our Incubation Grants lead to new top charities?  \niii. Do our grants lead to high quality public evidence on promising \ninterventions (whether or not they turn into top charities)?  \n\n \n 4. Improve the robustness of our to ols (e.g., our cost -effectiveness model): our decisions \nare a function of the data we have and the tools we use to analyze that data. Flaws in \nthose tools can lead us to make poor decisions. This work aims to improve the reliability \nof the tools we use.  \na. Metrics:  \ni. Do we successfully address and reduce the number of major \nproblems/weaknesses we see in our tools? How many problems do we \naddress?  \nDiscuss why you believe in this relative priority (facts, experience, external input)  \n● Why is #1 prioritized most high ly? \n○ Intuitively, it's compelling to me that GiveWell should be wary of letting the quality \nand scope of its research product degrade given that we've been successful with \nthis product and we're not allocating an undue amount of capacity to it.  \n○ Conversatio ns with major donors often focus on (a) updates on our top charities \nand (b) information about new top charities we're actively considering. These two \ntopics are the ones that major donors ask about most often. My impression from \nthose conversations is tha t they expect us to have a good understanding of those \norganizations and what they're doing.  \n■ When we had no new top charities in 2014 and 2015, it seemed as if \ndonors and followers closest to us were skeptical of the value of our \nongoing work. New top char ities (especially Malaria Consortium, \nimplementing a new intervention) helped to address these concerns.  \n● Why is intervention prioritization prioritized 2nd?  \n○ In our experience, the decisive factor in our charity recommendation is the \nevidence base and cost -effectiveness of interventions. We've consistently had \nthe experience that intervention results (strength of evidence and cost -\neffectiveness) drive our final  conclusions significantly more than organizational \nfactors do (see this post  discussing GiveDirectly vs SCI as an example). We \ntherefo re believe that assessing interventions is key to identifying charities that \nwe'll ultimately decide are as good as or better than our top charities.  \n○ We view this as a high priority because we know that are numerous interventions \nin addition to large areas  (such as education or agriculture) that we haven't \nrecently assessed. I'd guess that the domains we haven't investigated (both \nspecific interventions and larger domains like education and agriculture) in depth \nrepresent some of the most likely areas where  we'll find new priority programs as \npromising or more promising than our top charities.  \n○ There will come a point where we complete this work and can lower its priority. In \nthe next 12 -24 months, I expect we'll make substantial progress on this work and \nhave a much better sense for whether we should continue this work or \nchange/stop it. My best guess is that this will move to a much lower priority within \nthe next two years (most likely subsumed under the goal above taking \nsignificantly less capacity).  \n● Why is  GIG/building for the future prioritized 3rd?  \n\n \n ○ GIG \n■ Over the past few years, we've struggled to find new top charities that are \nas promising as or more promising than our current top charities. \nNotwithstanding the bullet above about intervention prioritization, I'd \nguess that we've done a fairly good job identifying the low hanging fruit in \nGiveWell's first 10 years. GIG -- directly supporting the development of \nnew top charities -- offers an opportunity to grow this pool directly.  \n■ Deciding how mu ch capacity to direct to GIG has been challenging. Over \nthe past 18 months, I've devoted a significant amount of my time to \nbuilding the program. I've also tasked other staff members -- Natalie, \nJosh, and Sophie, in particular -- who've all played signific ant roles. I now \nbelieve the program is operating well in that (a) we have grants/ongoing \nprojects that cover the full scope of the GIG pipeline (impact \nevaluation/research, seed funding, and M&E support) and (b) important \npotential partners (JPAL, IPA, CH AI, CEGA, Guide at Georgetown, GIF, \nDIV, IDinsight, Evidence Action, the EA community) are aware of and \nreach out to us about potential grant opportunities, but (c) we have little \ninformation/reason to believe that the bets we've made (bets that specific \ngrants will lead to new top charities) will succeed. I'm hesitant to invest \nmore -- funding or capacity -- in this area until we have a better sense of \nhow well our bets will work out. (We expect the first concrete evaluation of \nthis strategy to come the fa ll of 2017 when we evaluate No Lean Season, \nan early GIG grantee for a top charity recommendation).  \n■ We're currently allocating time to GIG to maintain our current set of \npriorities and we're opportunistically considering additional grants if/when \nthey seem  particularly promising relative to our current portfolio, but we're \nnot proactively trying to grow the portfolio.  \n○ With recruitment, we have slowly built our research team and don't see pressing \nconcrete gaps to fill.  \n■ It's possible that we'll want to add additional specialists to evaluate \nliterature, but we're in the process of evaluating / will be in the process of \nevaluating two this fall (Caitlin and Stephan), and I'd like to get a better \nsense of their capabilities before hiring more.  \n■ Otherwise, we're aiming to try to add other people who are similar to \nresearch staff who've been most successful in the past, i.e., values -\naligned, technical people who have some work experience. We don't \ncurrently see other gaps we think we could/should realistically try to fill.  \n● Improving tools such as our cost -effectiveness model  \n○ This is prioritized last because, based on past experience of (a) reanalyzing our \ntools or (b) donors scrutinizing our tools, I think it's likely that GiveWell would be \nOK -- survive/continue to  thrive -- even if our tools remain suboptimal for the next \ncouple of years. That's because we haven't historically fundamentally changed \nour conclusions based on reassessing our tools and donors have rarely been \ndisappointed by the quality of our research . \n\n \n ○ Nonetheless, I think a crucial part of our past success -- both consistently \nimproving the quality of our research and analysis and showing donors that our \nresearch is high quality -- has been due to offering the highest quality research \nwe can.  \n○ Given t hat we see important gaps in the quality of our tools, we want to work to \nimprove them. I'm worried about the long -term success of a GiveWell that \nactively ignores known, obvious weaknesses in its methods.  \nDiscuss what it would take to change your perspect ive \n \nBelow, I'm going to list a bunch of things we could do differently and then follow it up with what \nwould cause me to change my mind about each.  \nThings we could do differently on research:  \n \n1. More work on GIG via more networking/searching for grant oppor tunities and allocating \nmore of the funding we influence to GIG. One easy type of grant we could make more of \nwould be supporting the developing of high quality M&E systems for charities who might \nbe recommended if they had that.  \n2. Deepen our knowledge about  top charities via more closely following them and more site \nvisits  \n3. New approaches to serve other donors: we could focus our research on trying to bring in \nmore donors researching and writing about causes / topics that we think will get us \nattention (e.g.,  disaster relief)  \n4. Intellectual home of giving blog: when Holden was blogging regularly, the GiveWell blog \nwas a place where we published posts about philosophy/theory of giving. With Holden's \nmove to Open Philanthropy, we've stopped this.  \n5. Be helpful to bil lionaires/foundations: we could pivot and take a more consultant -like \napproach to understanding what UHNW donors want and trying to give that to them  \n6. A subset of this sort of work would be focusing research that might be useful in \ninfluencing bilaterals. S ome specific possibilities: evaluations of major recipients of \nbilateral funding (the Global Fund, GAVI, UNICEF); evaluations of elimination vs control \ncampaigns for malaria or NTDs.  \n7. Change approach and try to evaluate more charities more shallowly: we co uld go back \nto our original vision and try to create a menu of charities that we evaluate at a shallow \nlevel.  \n8. Focus evaluation on charities instead of interventions: we could go back to what \nGiveWell did c. 2009 -2011 and focus more of our energy on findin g, talking to, and \nevaluating charities independent of the independent evidence for the effectiveness/cost -\neffectiveness of their intervention  \n9. Make GW research smaller: we could scale down our staff and focus research primarily \non goal #1 above -- maintain  our traditional top charities product.  \n\n \n What would cause me to prioritize X more highly than we currently are:  \n \n1. There are two major reasons I don't want to prioritize GIG more highly right now: (a) \nwe've taken a handful of bets on various incubation grants, and I'd like to see whether \nour hit rate is high enough to justify increased investment and (b) I'm optimistic that non -\nGIG efforts (i.e., intervention prioritization and continuing to solicit applications from the \nmost promising charities we can f ind) will create new top charities. Either factor could \nchange and that would cause me to reassess GIG's priority.  \n2. If we made a major error in our assessment of a charity or if we heard donors pushing \nback that we hadn't gone deep enough, I'd consider this . For now, my impression is that \nwe've historically gone deeper than necessary, and we're trying to tack in the other \ndirection.  \n3. For all research priorities where the goal is \"raise money\" rather than \"find the best \nopportunities possible,\" there are three  things that could affect prioritization: (a) we could \nmeet a major donor where the benefit of engagement is worth reprioritization (e.g., \nanother Good Ventures -sized donor would make me seriously consider changing \nresearch priorities), (b) we fail to rais e money through other approaches to outreach and \nusing our research capacity seems like the most promising path, or (c) we believe that \nour research capacity is unlikely to make meaningful progress on finding better giving \nopportunities so it's worth alloc ating it to the goal of increasing our money moved.  \n4. See above.  \n5. See above.  \n6. The above is true though, in this case, my instinct is that using research capacity is more \nlikely. Amanda Glassman at CGD thinks we should take this approach; conversations \nI've had  with DFID have often led to their asking us to provide follow up that utilizes \nresearch capacity (minimal to date).  \n7. This seems very unlikely. I'm skeptical we can do this well (i.e., complete shallow \ninvestigations that reach useful conclusions) and I'd b et that this wouldn't be useful to \nmany donor dollars based on our past experience with a GiveWell charities menu and \nwhat I've heard from donors over the years about what they value in our research. If I \nbelieved that a significant amount of funding truly  wanted this and I could see the path to \ndoing this successfully, I'd revisit.  \n8. Recent interactions with charities that we've reached out to implies that the M&E data \nmost charities have is similar to what they had in the 2009 -11 period, so this approach \nwouldn't likely yield more top charities. If charities came to us with compelling impact \nevaluation data, I'd change my mind.  \n9. We'd do this if the above didn't seem to be working.  \nDiscuss ways you would receive input required to change your perspective  \n● The pr iority of GIG will most likely change based on the success/failure of our past \ngrants and our ongoing success with finding new top charities in other ways. I expect \nthat we're going to have to let time pass to decide whether or not we should change its \nrelative priority.  \n\n \n ● Deciding to go deeper on charities would come in reaction to a problem. I feel good \nabout the level at which we're monitoring charities, and I could imagine discovering a \nproblem that causes us to want to invest more heavily in this priorit y. We speak to \ndonors regularly and we'd know if our major donors had concerns about the level of \ndepth/intensity of our reviews. So a change here would most likely be reactive to \nproblems or donor complaints.  \n○ The most likely ways we'd learn about problems  would be (a) our own ongoing \nfollow up identifies something we missed before, (b) donors ask us questions \nabout a charity that we can't answer but seem important; that, itself, might \nconvince us we made a mistake in not assessing a charity more deeply bef ore; \nit's also possible investigation driven by a donor's question causes us to find a \nproblem; or (c) some external reporting (media or academic research) informs us \nabout a problem.  \n● Re: 4 -6: we're in the process of developing our outreach strategy; we'r e also having \nconversations with people about how we might approach our project of influencing \nbilaterals. This is an active area of investigation where we're talking to people with varied \nexperience: fundraising, marketing, media, work with/in bilaterals and those \nconversations could change our prioritization of work within outreach. My preference is \nto focus on outreach efforts that don't require a major shift in our research, but if other \napproaches to outreach fail or if these seem like the most promisi ng approaches for \noutreach, we'd revisit.  \n● I'm not planning proactive steps to reassess 7 -9. \nOperations  \nName top 3 goals/metrics in operations  \n \n1. Maintain quality of our work across operations' key domains: donations processing, \nfinance & accounting, office management (including IT and reception), HR, legal, and \nwebsite.  \na. Metrics: Quantitative metrics are of limited value here, but they include things \nlike:  \ni. HR: are we completing all onboarding steps on a similar timeline / to \nsimilar degree as we were in 2016 ? \nii. Donations: the donations team has some specific quantitative metrics for \nthings like turnaround time to respond to donor questions.  \niii. IT: no significant internet downtime.  \niv. Websites: similar levels of downtime (very low) for maintenance; similar \nlag time on publishing content etc.  \n2. Build a team that has the appropriate capacity and expertise to maintain and improve \nour work across our domains while maintaining good work/life balance for all team \nmembers  \n\n \n a. Leverage operations staff: Similar to Elie’s first goa l, a key priority for me is to \nmaximize the long term impact of operations staff, especially my reports. I’m \nplanning to take a similar approach to Elie to accomplish this, and to measure \nsuccess at a high level by expanding the scope of what each person c an do \nwhile limiting the time I spend.  \nb. Hire new staff: In addition, we're actively recruiting a Controller, which will allow \nus to consolidate all finance & accounting work under one person and reduce the \nburden of that work on Sarah, other ops team member s (who we’d like to have \nfocus on other work), and Natalie (who still works on the budget, grant \nreconciliation, and metrics).  \ni. After we onboard the Controller, we plan to assess the team’s capacity \nand expertise to determine whether additional hiring is n ecessary.  \nc. Metrics:  \ni. Onboard Controller by September 2017?  \nii. Eliminate the need to rely on non -ops staff for ops work (possibly with one \nor two small exceptions, including research support management?) by \nearly 2018?  \niii. Maintain the quality of operations work a nd make significant progress on \nimprovements without ops staff working more than they can/want \nbetween now and mid -2018?  \n3. Implement significant improvements to operations and build for the future  \na. We plan to make improvements across all of the key ops domai ns, to varying \ndegrees. Short -term projects we plan to accomplish in H2 2017 are described in \nthe Operations H2 2017 Vision and Plan  [LINK REMOVED].  That plan also \nincludes lower priority projects that we plan to tackle in 2018 (or sooner, \ndepending on how  much progress we make in 2017).  \nb. Metrics: Vary from domain to domain. High level goals for each domain (roughly \nin order of priority; timeline to make significant progress varies depending on \npriority, but we’d like to accomplish the bulk of this work by the end of 2018):  \ni. Technical work: Address highest -priority technical problems, largely in \ndonations tech. This work overlaps with / is essential for improvements \nwe want to make in other domains.  \n1. Highest priority improvement project in this domain: impleme nt a \nbetter data integration system between our credit card processor \n(Braintree) and CRM (Salesforce) by early 2018.  \n2. We have some assessment work to do before we prioritize and \nstart the other potential projects we could do in this area. This is \non hold until we hire a Controller, because the staff member who \nwill be responsible for this is handling some finance work in the \ninterim. We plan to prioritize these projects by the end of 2017.  \nii. Finance & accounting: Reduce reliance on manual processes so that this \nwork takes staff less time and costs us less money relative to donation \nvolume (e.g., monthly close, grant reconciliation, updating the budget, \n\n \n audit). Improve and transition to different systems and processes so we’re \nequipped to scale as donors/dona tions grow.  \n1. Projects are detailed here [LINK REMOVED].  \niii. Donations processing: Improve systems and processes to reduce \nreliance on manual processes, reduce room for error, and maintain or \nimprove the donor experience as the number of donors and donations \ngrow. \n1. If we decide to switch to a new system for managing donor \ncommunications, implement new system before giving season \n2017 or, if that isn't possible due to other priorities and lack of in -\nhouse expertise, by mid -2018.  \n2. Other projects we plan to prioritiz e next are listed here [LINK \nREMOVED].  \niv. HR: Improve essential areas (essential = onboarding, offboarding, \nbenefits administration). E.g., onboarding needs to be streamlined and \nreviewed for things that we can make smoother for new staff. Improve \nareas outsi de of essential HR functions, including, e.g., offering staff more \nfrequent meetings with someone outside of their management chain.   \nv. Other tech: improve data security, separate GiveWell and Open Phil \nsystems, website improvements necessary for outreach w ork.  \nvi. Recruiting / retention: diversity & inclusion  \nvii. Legal / risk management: update miscellaneous outdated policies, \nimprove governance procedures, etc.  \n \nDiscuss why you believe in this relative priority (facts, experience, external input)  \nOperations is generally performing its essential functions without major problems, but it's not \nfunctioning optimally.  \n \nBuilding a team with appropriate capacity and expertise will allow us to continue maintaining ops \n(priority #1) and set us up to make i mprovements and build for the future (priority #2). This goal \nis also critical for retention – people will leave if we’re asking them to do too much on an \nongoing basis, and/or if we’re constantly asking people to perform tasks outside of their abilities \nand interests. We based the decision to hire a Controller on input from contacts at other \norganizations (Room to Read, Donors Choose, New Profit) and from our outsourced accounting \nfirm, BPM. We think several factors make this the right time to hire someone  with accounting \nexperience to lead this work: donations volume, number of payment platforms we use, our \ngrantmaking practices (numerous grants/year, including to international entities), increases in \nnumber of employee expenses and AP payments.  \n \nOnce we’ ve strengthened operations through a combination of goals 1 and 2, there are several \nareas within operations that could be improved. Whether or not it’s worth it to do all of the \nprojects we could depends partly on whether or not our donations volume grows  and we invest \nin outreach, because we could maintain things as they stand today without making many \n\n \n improvements. Some improvements are probably worthwhile either way (e.g., reducing some of \nour reliance on manual processes to save staff time and reduce r oom for error). Others won’t be \nnecessary if we don’t invest in outreach and/or start to see significant growth in the number of \ndonations we’re processing (e.g., website improvements related to SEO, additional donations \nprocessing improvements beyond the lowest hanging fruit).  \nDiscuss what it would take to change your perspective  \nI folded this into my previous answer. I could try to separate these out if that seems helpful.  \nDiscuss ways you would receive input required to change your perspective  \nI’m unsu re how to answer this in a way that's useful. Obviously, if the things I'm assuming above \ndon't play out as I expect, then I'd change my perspective, but that doesn't seem useful.  \nOutreach  \nName top 3 goals/metrics in Outreach  \n1. Increase our long -term (i.e., 5-10 years from now) money moved as much as possible  \n2. To accomplish this goal, set the plan/structure for our outreach work going forward: i.e., \nwhat approaches/segments should we focus on? How should we structure GiveWell to \nincrease the impact this work h as? \nMetrics  \n1. What is our average money moved 5 -10 years from now?  \n2. Do we have a compelling plan/strategy for outreach 12 months from now?  \nDiscuss why you believe in this relative priority (facts, experience, external input)  \n \nThis prioritization is aimed at i ncreasing our long -term money moved. I'm happy to discuss why I \nthink money moved is the right goal at the expense of other possible goals such as (a) \nmaximizing the number of donors who use our research or (b) trying to increase \nphilanthropy's/donors' foc us in general towards metrics and rigorous evaluation.  \nDiscuss what it would take to change your perspective  \nThis framework may not work well in this case since we're explicitly in a phase of exploration \nand assessment. We're actively trying to assess what  path we should take with outreach, so in \neach of our high -potential approaches we're talking to advisors/external parties that may be \nhelpful and trying to take opportunities to experiment with possibilities in the hopes of learning \nmore about the potenti al impacts of various types of work.  \n \n\n \n As part of developing this strategy, we'll have to figure out what sort of team/budget we want \noutreach to have. In addition to the possibility of fundraising to increase our budget, we have \nsignificant funding on hand  as a result of the split with Open Phil.  \nDiscuss ways you would receive the input to change your perspective  \n \nI'm actively talking to people aiming to clarify my perspective. I expect it will evolve substantially \nin the coming months.  \n \nConcretely:  \n● Aid Agencies - I've talked to people at USAID, DFID, CGD, Evidence Action, \nGiveDirectly, Michael Anderson (former head of CIFF), Ann Mei Cheng (former head of \nthe Lab at USAID), and staff/former staff of CHAI and GAVI  \n● Media - I talked to YCombinator and at the ir recommendation we hired Big Swing \nCommunications (the PR firm that works with YC companies).  \n● General marketing - have talked to YC, a donor of ours who works in management \nconsulting and the people who led growth at Quora and Dropbox.  \n● HNW donors - have not done very much of this yet. Have largely talked to Chuck \nSlaughter of Living Goods.  "

​proactive \npriority. \nThis​ ​document​ ​summarizes​ ​our​ ​progress​ ​and​ ​plans. \nCurrent​ ​goals​ ​and​ ​plans \nOur​ ​goal​ ​is​ ​to​ ​raise​ ​an​ ​additional​ ​$60-100​ ​million​ ​dollars​​ ​in​ ​non-Good​ ​Ventures,​ ​annual​ ​money​ ​moved \nby​ ​giving​ ​season​ ​2022​ ​(5​ ​years​ ​from​ ​now). \nNote​ ​that​ ​​~80%​ ​of​ ​our​ ​non-Good​ ​Ventures​ ​money​ ​moved​ ​comes​ ​from​ ​the​ ​largest​ ​2%​ ​of​ ​our​ ​donors \n(those​ ​giving​ ​$10,000+)​,​ ​so​ ​we​ ​should​ ​likely​ ​focus​ ​on​ ​donors​ ​who​ ​give​ ​more​ ​than​ ​$10,000/year. \nOur​ ​medium-term​ ​(through​ ​early​ ​2018)​ ​goal​ ​is​ ​to​ ​test​ ​out​ ​the​ ​most​ ​promising​ ​approaches​ ​to​ ​see \nwhich​ ​seem​ ​worth​ ​investing​ ​in​ ​further.​ ​​Investing​ ​further​ ​might​ ​mean​ ​allocating​ ​a​ ​significant​ ​amount​ ​of \nmoney​ ​to​ ​some​ ​outreach​ ​activity​ ​(e.g.,​ ​advertising)​ ​or​ ​hiring​ ​a​ ​team​ ​of​ ​full-time​ ​staff. \nWork​ ​so​ ​far \nWe're​ ​experimenting​ ​with​ ​work​ ​in​ ​the​ ​following​ ​areas: \n● Media/\"influencers\"/public​ ​intellectuals: \n○What​ ​is​ ​it?​​ ​GiveWell​ ​being​ ​featured​ ​in​ ​the​ ​media​ ​and​ ​endorsed​ ​by​ ​other​ ​people​ ​with \nsignificant​ ​public​ ​followings.​ ​This​ ​has​ ​driven​ ​a​ ​large​ ​proportion​ ​of​ ​the​ ​money​ ​we've​ ​moved \nhistorically.  1\n○What​ ​are​ ​we​ ​doing?​ ​​We've​ ​retained​ ​a​ ​PR​ ​firm​ ​to​ ​work​ ​with​ ​us​ ​in​ ​advance​ ​of​ ​and​ ​during \ngiving​ ​season​ ​2017.​\n \n \n○Current​ ​thinking:​​ ​We​ ​still​ ​need​ ​to​ ​create​ ​a​ ​more​ ​systematic​ ​plan​ ​for​ ​all​ ​of​ ​this,​ ​and​ ​it \ngenerally​ ​seems​ ​like​ ​a​ ​high​ ​potential​ ​area​ ​that​ ​we​ ​haven't​ ​yet​ ​fully​ ​figured​ ​out.  2\n○How​ ​will​ ​we​ ​measure​ ​success?​​ ​We'll​ ​look​ ​at​ ​media​ ​coverage​ ​this​ ​giving​ ​season \n(through​ ​December​ ​31,​ ​2017)​ ​attributable​ ​to​ ​the​ ​firm.​ ​If​ ​we​ ​can​ ​attribute​ ​at​ ​least​ ​one \nhigh-quality​ ​story​ ​in​ ​major​ ​media​ ​(e.g.,​ ​NYT,​ ​NPR,​ ​Financial​ ​Times)​ ​or \n1​ ​Peter​ ​Singer​ ​via​ ​his​ ​books​ ​and​ ​media​ ​appearances,​ ​The​ ​New​ ​York​ ​Times,​ ​Podcast​ ​interviews​ ​with​ ​Will​ ​MacAskill,​ ​Others​ ​including \nNick​ ​Kristof,​ ​Farhad​ ​Manjoo,​ ​Ron​ ​Lieber,​ ​Tim​ ​Harford,​ ​Alex​ ​Tabarok. \n2​ ​Other​ ​things​ ​we​ ​could​ ​do​ ​include:​ ​Systematically​ ​building​ ​and​ ​maintaining​ ​relationships​ ​with​ ​media​ ​like​ ​we​ ​do​ ​donors.​ ​Focusing​ ​on \ncreating​ ​more​ ​content​ ​that​ ​answers​ ​questions​ ​about​ ​giving​ ​or​ ​international​ ​aid​ ​that's​ ​l kely​ ​to​ ​be​ ​shared​ ​by​ ​the​ ​media​ ​that​ ​likely \nmatters​ ​most​ ​to​ ​us.​ ​Explicitly​ ​asking​ ​media​ ​for​ ​direct​ ​endorsements​ ​via​ ​Tweets​ ​or​ ​posts​ ​and​

\nthat,​ ​we'll​ ​consider​ ​it​ ​a​ ​success.  3\n● Digital​ ​marketing \n○What​ ​is​ ​it?​​ ​Using​ ​online​ ​marketing​ ​(search​ ​engine​ ​optimization,​ ​Google​ ​AdWords, \npodcast​ ​ads)​ ​to​ ​reach​ ​new​ ​donors​ ​and​ ​our​ ​website​ ​as​ ​a​ ​crucial​ ​tool​ ​in​ ​raising​ ​more \nmoney. \n○What​ ​are​ ​we​ ​doing?​ ​​We've​ ​retained​ ​a​ ​digital​ ​marketing​ ​consultant​ ​who​ ​is​ ​focusing​ ​on​ ​(a) \nfixing​ ​our​ ​tracking​ ​and​ ​metrics,​ ​(b)​ ​improving​ ​our​ ​SEO,​ ​SEM​ ​and​ ​Facebook​ ​advertising, \n(c)​ ​working​ ​to​ ​optimize​ ​our​ ​site​ ​for​ ​donations,​

​give. \n○Current​ ​thinking​:​ ​My​ ​instinct​ ​is​ ​that​ ​the​ ​most​ ​important​ ​piece​ ​of​ ​this​ ​work​ ​is​ ​(d):​ ​it \nfocuses​ ​on​ ​larger​ ​donors​ ​and​ ​they're​ ​the​ ​ones​ ​who​ ​make​ ​up​ ​80%​ ​of​ ​the​ ​money​ ​we​ ​move. \nI​ ​largely​ ​see​ ​working​ ​with​ ​the​ ​consultant​ ​as​ ​an​ ​experiment​ ​in​ ​helping​ ​us​ ​learn​ ​more​ ​about \nwhether​ ​he's​ ​the​ ​sort​ ​of​ ​person​ ​who​ ​could​ ​really​ ​help​ ​us​ ​with​ ​(d)​ ​long-term.​ ​A​ ​fringe \nbenefit​ ​is​ ​that​ ​it​ ​may​ ​drive​ ​some​ ​more​ ​smaller​ ​donors​ ​and​ ​improve​ ​our​ ​tracking. \n○How​ ​will​ ​we​ ​measure​ ​success?​​ ​By​ ​December​ ​31,​ ​2017,​ ​we​ ​should​ ​have​ ​the​ ​below; \nthese​ ​are​ ​fairly​ ​subjective,​ ​but​ ​we'll​ ​assess​ ​their​ ​value​ ​(especially​ ​the​ ​increase​ ​in​ ​dollars \ndonated)​ ​against​ ​the​ ​cost​ ​of​ ​the​ ​consultant. \n■ Cost:​ ​. \n■ Process​ ​improvements: \n■ High-quality​ ​tracking​ ​of​ ​donors​ ​through​ ​our​ ​website,​ ​so​ ​we​ ​should​ ​be \nable​ ​to​ ​directly​ ​connect​ ​donors​ ​to​ ​visits​ ​to​ ​the​ ​website​ ​and​ ​measure​ ​the \nimpact​ ​of​ ​different​ ​channels​ ​(i.e.,​ ​SEO,​ ​SEM,​ ​specific​ ​referral​ ​links). \n■ Progress​ ​towards​ ​a​ ​flow​ ​donors​ ​who​ ​aren't​ ​ready​ ​to​ ​give​ ​but​ ​want​ ​to \nlearn​ ​more​ ​which​ ​allows​ ​us​ ​to​ ​track​ ​and​ ​follow​ ​up​

​consultant's​ ​work. \n■ Increase​ ​in​ ​the​ ​conversion​ ​rate​ ​of​ ​donors​ ​who​ ​come​ ​to​ ​our​ ​site. \n● Fundraising \n○What​ ​is​ ​it?​​ ​A​ ​broad​ ​category​ ​meant​ ​to​ ​include​ ​standard​ ​approaches​ ​non-profits​ ​take​ ​to \nraise​ ​money​ ​which​ ​you​ ​should​ ​associate​ ​with​ ​\"build​ ​a​ ​fundraising​ ​department.\"​ ​This \nincludes: \n■ Corporate​ ​and​

​donors. \n○What​ ​are​ ​we​ ​doing?​ ​​Largely​ ​exploring/thinking​ ​but​ ​it's​ ​the​ ​next​ ​most​ ​pressing​ ​priority​ ​to \nget​ ​started​ ​with.​ ​Brigid​ ​has​ ​been​ ​really​ ​helpful​ ​here;​ ​I've​ ​also​ ​talked​ ​to​ ​Erin​ ​Ganju​ ​the \nCEO​ ​of​ ​Room​ ​to​ ​Read​ ​about​ ​their​ ​work.​ ​(Room​ ​to​ ​Read​ ​is​ ​one​ ​of​ ​the​ ​more​ ​successful \nstories​ ​of​ ​the​ ​last​ ​decade​ ​of​ ​fundraising​ ​for​ ​international​ ​aid.) \n○Current​ ​thinking​:​ ​this​ ​seems​ ​promising​ ​because​ ​it's​ ​the​ ​standard​ ​approach​ ​nonprofits \ntake.​ ​It​ ​seems​ ​pretty​ ​likely​ ​that​ ​making​ ​progress​ ​on​ ​this​ ​is​ ​going​ ​to​ ​be​ ​the​ ​right​ ​next​ ​step. \nThat'll​ ​most​ ​likely​ ​mean​ ​me​ ​doing​ ​some​ ​work​ ​with​ ​some​ ​support​ ​to​ ​decide​ ​whether​ ​or​ ​not \nwe​ ​should​ ​try​ ​to​ ​hire​ ​someone. \n3 Cost:  \n. \n\n\n○ How ​  ​ will ​  ​ we ​  ​ measure ​  ​ success? ​ ​  ​ TBD ​  ​ for ​  ​ now ​  ​ since ​  ​ we ​  ​ haven't ​  ​ started ​  ​ our ​  ​ work.  \n ● Direct ​  ​ outreach ​  ​ to ​  ​ HNW ​  ​ donors  \n ○ What ​  ​ is ​  ​ it? ​  ​​ Because ​  ​ we ​  ​ expect ​  ​ that ​  ​ our ​  ​ outreach ​  ​ success ​  ​ will ​  ​ be ​  ​ determined ​  ​ by ​  ​ the  \n donations ​  ​ of ​  ​ a ​  ​ relatively ​  ​ small ​  ​ number ​  ​ of ​  ​ donors, ​  ​ it's ​  ​ possible ​  ​ that ​  ​ our ​  ​ optimal ​  ​ strategy ​  ​ will  \n be ​  ​ directly ​  ​ targeting ​  ​ donors ​  ​ who ​  ​ may ​  ​ give ​  ​ very ​  ​ large ​  ​ donations ​  ​ ($100k+).  \n ○ What ​  ​ are ​  ​ we ​  ​ doing? ​  ​​ I'm ​  ​ currently ​  ​ trying ​  ​ to ​  ​ have ​  ​ 20 ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ to ​  ​ get ​  ​ a ​  ​ better ​  ​ sense ​  ​ of ​  ​ the  \n costs, ​  ​ benefits, ​  ​ and ​  ​ expected ​  ​ value ​  ​ of ​  ​ this ​  ​ activity. ​  ​ I've ​  ​ scheduled ​  ​ ~5.  \n ○ Current ​  ​ thinking? ​ ​  ​ Very ​  ​ roughly, ​  ​ Holden ​  ​ and ​  ​ I ​  ​ have ​  ​ had ​  ​ 10-20 ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ like ​  ​ this ​  ​ in ​  ​ the  \n past, ​  ​ and ​  ​ I ​  ​ don't ​  ​ believe ​  ​ that ​  ​ any ​  ​ resulted ​  ​ in ​  ​ donations, ​  ​ but ​  ​ it's ​  ​ possible ​  ​ that ​  ​ changes ​  ​ to  \n (a) ​  ​ the ​  ​ GiveWell ​  ​ product ​  ​ since ​  ​ we ​  ​ had ​  ​ those ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ (2008-2012), ​  ​ (b) ​  ​ changes ​  ​ to ​  ​ the  \n pitch, ​  ​ or ​  ​ (c) ​  ​ changes ​  ​ to ​  ​ the ​  ​ process ​  ​ could ​  ​ yield ​  ​ a ​  ​ better ​  ​ hit ​  ​ rate.  4\n ○ How ​  ​ will ​  ​ we ​  ​ measure ​  ​ success? ​ ​  ​ Return ​  ​ and ​  ​ time ​  ​ cost ​  ​ of ​  ​ first ​  ​ round ​  ​ of ​  ​ meetings.   \n ● Outreach ​  ​ to ​  ​ government ​  ​ aid ​  ​ agencies  \n ○ What ​  ​ is ​  ​ it? ​ ​  ​ Government ​  ​ aid ​  ​ agencies ​  ​ give ​  ​ a ​  ​ huge ​  ​ amount ​  ​ of ​  ​ money ​  ​ (tens ​  ​ of ​  ​ billions ​  ​ of  \n dollars) ​  ​ so ​  ​ they're ​  ​ one ​  ​ of ​  ​ the ​  ​ best ​  ​ targets ​  ​ if ​  ​ we're ​  ​ trying ​  ​ to ​  ​ increase ​  ​ our ​  ​ money ​  ​ moved.  \n ○ What ​  ​ are ​  ​ we ​  ​ doing? ​  ​​ Trying ​  ​ to ​  ​ have ​  ​ conversations ​  ​ with ​  ​ people ​  ​ in ​  ​ the ​  ​ agencies ​  ​ and  \n others ​  ​ who ​  ​ know ​  ​ them ​  ​ well ​  ​ to ​  ​ get ​  ​ a ​  ​ sense ​  ​ of ​  ​ our ​  ​ prospects. ​  ​ We ​  ​ have ​  ​ a ​  ​ strong ​  ​ ally ​  ​ in ​  ​ the  \n UK's ​  ​ DFID ​  ​ who ​  ​ comes ​  ​ out ​  ​ of ​  ​ the ​  ​ effective ​  ​ altruism ​  ​ community ​  ​ and ​  ​ wants ​  ​ to ​  ​ help;  \n otherwise, ​  ​ I'm ​  ​ trying ​  ​ to ​  ​ keep ​  ​ my ​  ​ ear ​  ​ to ​  ​ the ​  ​ ground ​  ​ and ​  ​ have ​  ​ conversations ​  ​ as ​  ​ they ​  ​ come  \n up.  \n ○ Current ​  ​ status: ​  ​​ Largely ​  ​ slow ​  ​ burn ​  ​ and ​  ​ opportunistic ​  ​ beyond ​  ​ the ​  ​ contact ​  ​ at ​  ​ DFID. ​  ​ Key  \n next ​  ​ steps ​  ​ we ​  ​ may ​  ​ pursue ​  ​ boil ​  ​ down ​  ​ to ​  ​ allocating ​  ​ some ​  ​ research ​  ​ capacity ​  ​ to ​  ​ (a)  \n understand ​  ​ how ​  ​ major ​  ​ aid ​  ​ agencies ​  ​ work ​  ​ (how ​  ​ do ​  ​ they ​  ​ make ​  ​ decisions, ​  ​ where ​  ​ we ​  ​ might  \n we ​  ​ best ​  ​ fit ​  ​ in) ​  ​ and ​  ​ (b) ​  ​ understanding ​  ​ some ​  ​ of ​  ​ the ​  ​ smaller ​  ​ aid ​  ​ agencies ​  ​ (e.g., ​  ​ Norway,  \n Sweden) ​  ​ which ​  ​ are ​  ​ still ​  ​ very ​  ​ large ​  ​ donors.  \n ● Outreach ​  ​ to ​  ​ foundations  \n ○ Definitions ​ : ​  ​ Distinguish ​  ​ between ​  ​ two ​  ​ types ​  ​ of ​  ​ foundations: ​  ​ staffed ​  ​ and ​  ​ unstaffed. ​  ​ I ​  ​ think  \n unstaffed ​  ​ foundations ​  ​ are ​  ​ similar ​  ​ to ​  ​ HNW ​  ​ individuals ​  ​ and ​  ​ don't ​  ​ think ​  ​ there's ​  ​ a ​  ​ particular  \n strategy ​  ​ we ​  ​ should ​  ​ take ​  ​ that's ​  ​ different.  \n ○ Current ​  ​ status:  \n ■ Unstaffed: ​  ​ I ​  ​ think ​  ​ it ​  ​ largely ​  ​ makes ​  ​ sense ​  ​ to ​  ​ approach ​  ​ unstaffed ​  ​ foundations ​  ​ like  \n HNW ​  ​ donors. ​  ​ I'd ​  ​ include ​  ​ these ​  ​ in ​  ​ the ​  ​ HNW ​  ​ donor ​  ​ bucket ​  ​ above. ​  ​ We ​  ​ have  \n GiveWell ​  ​ top ​  ​ charities ​  ​ donors ​  ​ that ​  ​ are ​  ​ from ​  ​ unstaffed ​  ​ foundations ​  ​ and ​  ​ they ​  ​ seem  \n to ​  ​ operate ​  ​ like ​  ​ HNW ​  ​ individual ​  ​ donors ​  ​ do.  \n ■ Staffed: ​  ​ I ​  ​ don't ​  ​ think ​  ​ we're ​  ​ likely ​  ​ to ​  ​ convince ​  ​ staffed ​  ​ foundations ​  ​ (e.g., ​  ​ Hewlett,  \n Gates) ​  ​ to ​  ​ use ​  ​ our ​  ​ research. ​  ​ Instead, ​  ​ I've ​  ​ tried ​  ​ to ​  ​ build ​  ​ relationships ​  ​ with  \n like-minded ​  ​ funders ​  ​ that ​  ​ might ​  ​ \"co-fund\" ​  ​ opportunities ​  ​ with ​  ​ us ​  ​ that ​  ​ meet ​  ​ their  \n needs. ​  ​ Aligned ​  ​ funders ​  ​ include: ​  ​ ELMA ​  ​ Philanthropies, ​  ​ Global ​  ​ Innovation ​  ​ Fund,  \n IKEA ​  ​ Foundation, ​  ​ Lampert ​  ​ Family ​  ​ Foundation.   \n ○ Next ​  ​ steps? ​ ​  ​ I ​  ​ don't ​  ​ currently ​  ​ have ​  ​ great ​  ​ ideas ​  ​ for ​  ​ next ​  ​ steps ​  ​ here ​  ​ beyond ​  ​ building  \n existing ​  ​ relationships ​  ​ and ​  ​ looking ​  ​ out ​  ​ for ​  ​ more.  \n 4 ​  ​ It's ​  ​ also ​  ​ possible ​  ​ that ​  ​ we'll ​  ​ have ​  ​ a ​  ​ ~5% ​  ​ yield ​  ​ on ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ and ​  ​ if ​  ​ successful ​  ​ conversations ​  ​ average ​  ​ $500k/year, ​  ​ this ​  ​ could ​  ​ be ​  ​ a  \n scalable ​  ​ strategy ​  ​ would ​  ​ take ​  ​ ~750 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ / ​  ​ year ​  ​ for ​  ​ 200 ​  ​ donor ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ / ​  ​ year ​  ​ with ​  ​ expected ​  ​ yield ​  ​ of ​  ​ $5m. ​  ​ 750 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ assumes ​  ​ that  \n 75% ​  ​ of ​  ​ the ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ (150) ​  ​ take ​  ​ 2 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ each, ​  ​ 15% ​  ​ (30 ​  ​ meetings) ​  ​ take ​  ​ 5 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ each, ​  ​ and ​  ​ 10% ​  ​ of ​  ​ the ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ take ​  ​ 10 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ each  \n (20 ​  ​ meetings) ​  ​ = ​  ​ 300 ​  ​ + ​  ​ 150 ​  ​ + ​  ​ 200 ​  ​ = ​  ​ 650. ​  ​ Then, ​  ​ add ​  ​ 100 ​  ​ for ​  ​ general ​  ​ overhead/buffer. ​  ​ 750 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ of ​  ​ project ​  ​ work ​  ​ is ​  ​ roughly ​  ​ 50% ​  ​ of ​  ​ a  \n full-time ​  ​ staffer. ​  ​ On ​  ​ the ​  ​ other ​  ​ hand, ​  ​ if ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ take ​  ​ longer ​  ​ or ​  ​ the ​  ​ yield ​  ​ (dollar ​  ​ value ​  ​ or ​  ​ odds ​  ​ of ​  ​ success) ​  ​ is ​  ​ lower, ​  ​ it ​  ​ might ​  ​ not ​  ​ be  \n worth ​  ​ the ​  ​ effort ​  ​ to ​  ​ invest ​  ​ in ​  ​ this.  \n  \n  \n\n● Focus ​  ​ on ​  ​ research  \n ○ What ​  ​ is ​  ​ it? ​  ​​ Focus ​  ​ on ​  ​ research ​  ​ that ​  ​ helps ​  ​ build ​  ​ out ​  ​ answers ​  ​ to ​  ​ questions ​  ​ donors ​  ​ have.  \n For ​  ​ example, ​  ​ this ​  ​ might ​  ​ mean ​  ​ more ​  ​ focus ​  ​ on ​  ​ research ​  ​ useful ​  ​ in ​  ​ response ​  ​ to ​  ​ disasters ​  ​ or  \n more ​  ​ actively ​  ​ doing ​  ​ GiveWell ​  ​ Incubation ​  ​ Grant ​  ​ work ​  ​ in ​  ​ causes ​  ​ (education, ​  ​ surgery)  \n where ​  ​ our ​  ​ learning ​  ​ more ​  ​ about ​  ​ them ​  ​ would ​  ​ give ​  ​ us ​  ​ better ​  ​ answers ​  ​ for ​  ​ donors ​  ​ about ​  ​ our  \n views.  \n ○ What ​  ​ are ​  ​ we ​  ​ doing? ​  ​​ Nothing ​  ​ right ​  ​ now. ​  ​ There's ​  ​ a ​  ​ sharp ​  ​ line ​  ​ between ​  ​ research ​  ​ and  \n outreach. ​  ​ Research ​  ​ makes ​  ​ decisions ​  ​ based ​  ​ on ​  ​ trying ​  ​ to ​  ​ find ​  ​ the ​  ​ highest-return ​  ​ charities  \n and ​  ​ outreach ​  ​ tries ​  ​ to ​  ​ increase ​  ​ money ​  ​ moved ​  ​ as ​  ​ much ​  ​ as ​  ​ possible.  \n ○ Next ​  ​ steps? ​ ​  ​ I ​  ​ think ​  ​ this ​  ​ is ​  ​ worth ​  ​ doing ​  ​ but ​  ​ we ​  ​ don't ​  ​ have ​  ​ capacity ​  ​ for ​  ​ it ​  ​ now ​  ​ without  \n trading ​  ​ off ​  ​ on ​  ​ research ​  ​ and ​  ​ I ​  ​ want ​  ​ to ​  ​ give ​  ​ more ​  ​ standard ​  ​ outreach ​  ​ approaches ​  ​ a ​  ​ shot. ​  ​ A  \n major ​  ​ focus ​  ​ in ​  ​ our ​  ​ low-burn ​  ​ (job ​  ​ posting ​  ​ on ​  ​ our ​  ​ website) ​  ​ recruiting ​  ​ efforts ​  ​ is ​  ​ finding ​  ​ the  \n sort ​  ​ of ​  ​ person ​  ​ who ​  ​ could ​  ​ do ​  ​ this: ​  ​ i.e., ​  ​ a ​  ​ really ​  ​ strong ​  ​ researcher.  \n ● Other  \n ○ Improving ​  ​ metrics: ​  ​ our ​  ​ metrics ​  ​ are ​  ​ suboptimal ​  ​ in ​  ​ that ​  ​ they ​  ​ miss ​  ​ some ​  ​ money ​  ​ moved. ​  ​ Our  \n best ​  ​ guess ​  ​ is ​  ​ that ​  ​ we ​  ​ don't ​  ​ track ​  ​ ~25% ​  ​ ($10 ​  ​ million) ​  ​ of ​  ​ our ​  ​ non-Good ​  ​ Ventures ​  ​ money  \n moved. ​  ​ We're ​  ​ not ​  ​ sure ​  ​ how ​  ​ to ​  ​ fix ​  ​ this ​  ​ beyond ​  ​ making ​  ​ a ​  ​ push ​  ​ to ​  ​ get ​  ​ more ​  ​ donors ​  ​ to ​  ​ give  \n through ​  ​ us. ​  ​ What ​  ​ we ​  ​ call ​  ​ \"stewardship.\" ​  ​ This ​  ​ seems ​  ​ like ​  ​ a ​  ​ worthwhile ​  ​ thing ​  ​ to ​  ​ do.  \n  "

This policy is intended to ensure that donors to GiveWell need not worry\nabout our room for more funding: when we have more than we can productively use\nourselves, the result is more grants to the best charities we've found.\nWe seek to hold a reasonable level of assets: one that gives us a stable, predictable\nﬁnancial situation and the ability to plan and to take any outstanding opportunities\nthat come up (particularly with regard to hiring). Assets beyond what we feel we need\nin order to accomplish this are granted out. Details follow.\nDetails of the \"excess assets\" policy\nUnrestricted assets are the assets controlled by GiveWell that are available for\noperating expenses (this excludes assets held in our donor-advised fund as well as all\nassets restricted by donors in such a way that we can't use them for operating\nexpenses).GiveWell's \"excess assets\" policy »  »  » GIVEWELL'S \"EXCESS ASSETS\" POLICY HOME ABOUT OFFICIAL RECORDS\nGIVING EFFECTIVELY HOW WE WORK TOP CHARITIES RESEARCH OUR MISTAKES\nABOUT UPDATES\n\n10/18/2017 GiveW ell's \"excess assets\" policy | GiveW ell\nhttps://www .givewell.org/about/of ficial-records/Excess-Assets-Policy 2/3\"Months' worth of unrestricted assets\" refers to how many months we could operate,\naccording to current (generally conservative) expense projections, if revenue were to\ncease entirely.\nWe seek to be in a ﬁnancial position such that our cash ﬂow projections show us\nhaving 12 months' worth of unrestricted assets in each of the next 12 months. A couple\nof simpliﬁed examples to illustrate this idea:\n\"Excess assets\" are deﬁned as unrestricted assets in excess of what is needed to fulﬁl\nthe above criterion.\nAt each Board meeting at which we approve a budget (of which we have at least one\nper year), we assess the level of our \"excess assets\" and, if we have any, to irrevocably\nearmark them for regranting (the timing and nature of the grants will be at our\ndiscretion, but the grants cannot be made to GiveWell or an aﬃliated organization).\nUnrestricted assets arising from an extraordinary transaction, such as a sale of assets,\nmay be considered up to one year following the closing of such transaction, rather\nthan at the next Board meeting at which we approve a budget.If we had projected expenses of $30,000 per month (constant), and projected no\nnew revenue in the next 12 months, we would need $720,000 of unrestricted assets\nin order to fulﬁl the above criterion (in this case, we would be projecting\n$360,000.00 in unrestricted assets - just enough for 12 months - 12 months from\nnow).\nIf we had projected expenses of $30,000 per month (constant) and expected\n$500,000 of revenue to come in all at once six months from now, we would need\n$510,000 of unrestricted assets in order to fulﬁl the above criterion (in this case, we\nwould be projecting $360,000 in unrestricted assets - just enough for 12 months -\nﬁve months from now).\n\n10/18/2017 GiveW ell's \"excess assets\" policy | GiveW ell\nhttps://www .givewell.org/about/of ficial-records/Excess-Assets-Policy 3/3      HOME CONTACT STAY UPDATED FAQ FOR CHARITIES SITE MAP\nOPEN PHILANTHROPY PROJECT\nFOLLOW US:\n  EMAIL ADDRESS S U B M I TSUBSCRIBE TO EMAIL UPDATES:\nGiveWell, aka The Clear Fund (a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) public charity).

Among other things, this means that we will continue to \n(a) update our views on ou r current top charities, (b) look for and find new top charities and \ninterventions, (c) revise and improve our cost -effectiveness analysis, (d) through GiveWell \nIncubation Grants, continue to identify opportunities to generate more top charity contenders \nby funding research, start -up charities and improved monitoring all while maintaining the \nsame level of transparency that we have to date.  \na. As part of maintaining the quality of GiveWell's recommendations, we plan to formally \nrevisit the focus on global hea lth and development (GH&D). GiveWell chose to focus \non GH&D because our early research (2007 -2010) convinced us that GH&D offered \nthe best giving opportunities that met our criteria. However, at its core, GiveWell is \nnot focused on GH&D; we're focused on t he best giving opportunities that are \nevidence -backed, cost -effective and have room for more funding. While our \nexpectation is that revisiting this decision will lead us to maintain our focus on GH&D, \nwe plan to revisit this decision. The points below assu me that we continue to focus \non GH&D.  \n2. Comprehensively survey program areas in GH&D and have compelling answers for \nwhy we recommend the programs we do, and why we don't recommend others.  \nGiveWell has looked at many programs, but there remain many that we h aven't examined in \ndepth. For example, we would like to have a more systematic view of education, agriculture, \nreproductive health, and surgical interventions. There are also more general areas we \nhaven't formally evaluated such as health systems strengthe ning and disease elimination or \neradication programs. We plan to do research that allows us to assess these programs and \neither make them priority programs (and seek out charities that implement them) or formally \nexplain why we do not believe they are prom ising.  \na. This may also include approaches to GH&D that go beyond direct program delivery. \nFor example, philanthropy that aims to improve tobacco or road safety regulations \nglobally to improve health and reduce disability. As has been the case, such \nprograms would need to be evidence -backed, cost -effective, and scalable to be \npriority programs.  \n3. All charities that should be top charities are top charities . Currently, we may not \nrecommend some charities for reasons including (a) they misunderstand us, our value -\nadded, or our process so they don't apply, (b) we haven't completed the work to assess the \nevidence for the intervention they implement (see the bullet above), or (c) we have limited \ncapacity and have prioritized our work such that we haven't yet been able  to review some \npromising organizations. GiveWell should eventually overcome this hurdle and should be \nconfident that all charities that exist that would meet our criteria are recommended.  \n\n \n 4. GiveWell has created the mechanism and incentive for people to star t organizations \nthat could meet our criteria.  Taken together, we believe that the work laid out above will \ncreate the incentive for people to try to create high -impact nonprofits that meet our criteria \nbecause we can offer (a) financial support to people w ho want to start an organization, \nconduct early stage research or add M&E to a program they're already running through the \nGiveWell Incubation Grants program, (b) predictable criteria to determine whether or not an \norganization will be recommended, and (c)  significant funding if the organization succeeds.  \n \nThis is important because other than GiveWell we believe that these incentives are not \nnearly strong enough. GiveWell is uniquely positioned because we can offer both early stage \nfinancial support but al so significant funding to groups at scale. We believe that creating a \nstrong incentive for people to create high -impact organizations is a way through which we \ncould have significant long -term impact beyond the funding we move directly to our \nrecommendatio ns. \n \n \nOutreach  \n \nWe have historically put limited time into proactive outreach and have consistently treated \nresearch as a higher organizational priority. Given the quality of our research, we now believe \nthat outreach is at a similar priority level to rese arch and we anticipate allocating significant \ncapacity to it in the future.  \n \n1. We aim to significantly increase our money moved . Specifically, our non -Good Ventures \nmoney moved is currently approximately $40 million annually. We aim to increase that figure \nto $100 million annually. We do not have specific goals for whether this comes from one (or \nrelatively few) major donor(s) or a large number of smaller donors: our focus is on the \namount of funding we direct.  \na. In 2016, Good Ventures gave approximately $60 million to our recommendations \n($50 million to top charities and $10 million to GiveWell Incubation Grants). We \nexpect this funding to continue.  \n \nOperations / organizational goals  \n \nBefore mid -2016, we treated o perations as a low priority, and we have a lot of work to do to improve \nit. It is important that we get to a situation where:  \n \n1. GiveWell has high -quality operations . Our operations infrastructure, including our work in \ndonations processing, finance, legal, HR, tech, and office management, is high -quality and \ncan support our research and outreach goals.   \n2. GiveWell is a robust organization whose success does not rely on any one individual. \nFor all staff members, we have a contingency plan and ability to thrive  if we lose any \nindividual.  "

          "text": "GiveWell Financial Summary \nMeeting of the GiveWell Board of Directors –  June 18, 2018 \n\nAgenda \n1.Overview of board votes \n2.Looking back: Expenses and revenues in 2017 \na. For review and discussion only \n3.Looking forward: Expense and revenue projections 2018-2020 \na. Board decisions – more detail \nb. Our approach \nc. Budget proposal \nd. Revenue projections \n4.Board decisions – discussion and votes \n\nSummary of board votes \n1.Vote to approve 2018 and 2019 budgets \na. The 2018 budget was approved last year. We are requesting an increase in that budget of $0.7 \nmillion. \nb. The 2019 budget represents a $2.2 million increase over 2018. \n2.Vote to restrict unrestricted assets as restricted to grants to recommended \ncharities \na. Restrict a portion of an individual's donation so that their contribution does not exceed 20% of our \nexpected operating budget. \nb. Restrict a portion of our unrestricted assets in accordance with our excess assets policy. \n\nLooking back: 2017 summary \n●We spent very slightly less than we \nbudgeted in 2017 (-0.2%). \n○ Open Phil expenses are included through May. \n○ We spent 11% less than budgeted in the 2nd \nhalf of 2017 (after the Open Phil/GiveWell \nsplit). \n●Higher revenue in 2017 than expected, \nplus two large payments from Good \nVentures related to Open Phil separation. \n\n\nExpense projections vs. actuals for 2017 \n\n\nRevenue projections vs. actuals for 2017 \nIn addition, we received: \n● $2.45 million from Good \nVentures/Open Philanthropy \nProject to cover costs of \noperating the Open \nPhilanthropy Project from \nOctober 2016 to May 2017. \nReceived in 2018. \n● $2.65 million from Good \nVentures/Open Philanthropy \nProject for the sale of assets \nto the Open Philanthropy \nProject LLC. \n48% of total, \n69 donors \n24% of total, \n>4k donors \n14% of total, \n1 donor 14% of total, \n1 donor \n\nLooking forward: revenue projections and spending proposal \n●We propose planning for significant growth in spending, driven by hiring \n(primarily in outreach but some in research) from ~$5m year in 2018 to ~9m/year \nin 2020. \n○ We project that our revenues will continue to keep pace with such a growth in expenses over the \nnext two years. \n●Our asset level is high. Based on conservative revenue projections and the \nproposed spending plan, we recommend granting out ~$1.75m in unrestricted \nfunds per excess assets policy. \n\n\nItems for board vote – more detail \n1. Approval of budget: \nVote on revised 2018 budget and 2019 budgets. Note that we will propose an update to the 2019 budget in early to mid 2019. \n2. Application of 20% cap on single revenue source: \nOne individual gave a unrestricted donation that exceeds 20% of our 2018 operating budget. To action the rule of not \nsupporting more than 20% of our operations from a single revenue source, we are proposing a vote to irrevocably designate a \nportion of this donation as restricted for grants to recommended charities. \n3. Application of \"Excess Assets\" policy : \nGiveWell has an \"excess assets\" policy, specifying that once we surpass a certain level of unrestricted assets, we grant out the \nexcess rather than continue to hold it ourselves. We estimate that our current asset level is above the level specified in the \npolicy and that the board should irrevocably designate a potion of unrestricted assets as restricted for grants to recommended \ncharities. \n\nBudget for 2018-2020 – approach \n●Be conservative: Set the budget to minimize (<5% chance) the chance that we \nidentify a high-impact opportunity to spend funds but don't have funds available \nto take advantage of that opportunity. \n○ Budgeting for major growth in staff, across all three areas of the organization (operations, outreach, \nand research) in both entry-level and senior positions, as well as for significant growth in \nadvertising, outreach consultants, and staff recruitment. \n●Budget for current staff compensation with annual increases, projected hires, and \nother expense categories based on experience and anticipated changes. Add 10% \nof non-staff total for unexpected expenses. \n\nProposed budget for 2018-2020 \n* 2017 total is H2 amount doubled, because H1 includes \nOpen Philanthropy costs and is not comparable to \n2018-2020 \n\nBudget for 2018-2020 \n* 2018 amount is compared to doubled amount from H2 2017 \n\n\nChanges to 2018 budget since mid-2017 \nNotes: \n● Budget increase of $750k. \n● Increase driven by \nadvertising (+$225k), \naddition of buffer (+$200k), \nstaff recruitment (+$140k), \naccounting fees (+$85k) and \ntravel (+$75k). \n\nRevenue projections for 2018-2020 – approach \nCategory Projected growth rate – best guess Projected growth \nrate – \nconservative Comments \nGood Ventures Set at 20% of operating expenses Same \nPrivate individual Set at 20% of operating expenses Same Unlikely to exceed ~$2 million/year \nOther major institutions No growth No growth \nOther $100,000+ donors 0%\n0% No sustained recent growth in this group \nDonors giving $10,000 - $99,999 10% 0% Amount from this group has been quite variable but growth in \nnumber of donors suggests this category will at least been \nmaintained and likely grow modestly. \nDonors giving $1,000 - $9,999 10% 0% Same as above. \nDonors giving $100 - $999 36% in 2018, then 10% per year 0% Have seen sustained growth from this group. \nDonors giving under $100 50% in 2018, then 10% per year 0% Have seen high, sustained growth from this group. \nAnonymous donors 0% 0% Donations received without designations and without donor \ncontact information are recorded as unrestricted. \n\nExcess assets test \n●Using the proposed budget and conservative revenue projection indicates that, according to the \nExcess Assets policy, the board should vote to designate $1.75 million in unrestricted assets as \nrestricted to grants to recommended charities. \n●Using the proposed budget and best guess revenue projection, we project that, if we make the  \nproposed excess assets grant, we will continue to have at least 12-months of reserves available \nuntil late 2020. In other words, we expect to have ample time to make adjustments (e.g. \nincrease fundraising efforts, reduce spending growth) as of the next planned board review in \nmid-2019. \n\n\nExcess assets test \n\n\nItems for board vote \n1. Approval of budget: \nVote on revised 2018 budget and 2019 budgets. Note that 2019 budget will likely be updated in early to mid 2019. \nWith the approval of this budget, GiveWell will request a grant from Good Ventures of 20% of 2018 operating expenses, less \nthe estimate of rent replacement value: $751,179. \n2. Application of 20% cap on single revenue source: \nVote on proposal to irrevocably designate $1,121,005 of the $2,100,000 unrestricted donation from a private individual as \nrestricted for grants to recommended charities. $1,121,005 is the difference between $2,100,000 and 20% of our budgeted \noperating costs for 2018 ($978,995). \n3. Application of \"Excess Assets\" policy: \nVote on proposal to irrevocably designate $1,751,256 of unrestricted assets as restricted to grants to recommended charities. \n"

          "text": "Executive compensation review  This document includes three categories of comparables for executive compensation at GiveWell, and a proposal for raising the salary of Elie Hassenfeld, GiveWell's Executive Director:  ● Foundations: Private data drawn from a compensation survey of 131 foundations (2016 data)  ● Research not--for--profits: Public data from the 990s of nine not-for-profit organizations conducting research and charity evaluation (2016 data)  ● Academics: Economics professors at the University of California, Berkeley (2016 data). ● Open Philanthropy Project: Open Philanthropy Project compensation information.  Compensation proposal: Elie proposes raising his annual salary from $200,000 to $250,000.   Foundations   Note that we did not update this data for 2018. Below, we use the same data we showed last year: 2016 compensation data for foundations.  We have private data from a 2016 survey of 131 foundations by Lasnik--Broida Consultants, Inc. in collaboration with The Croner Company. Below is aggregate information about total compensation for CEOs among foundations with 16-50 employees.  CEO Compensation at Foundations with 16-50 employees  (n = 52)  25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile Base pay $378,000 $427,500 $529,900 Total compensation $449,000 $504,900 $649,600  And here is the aggregate information about total compensation for CEOs among foundations with more than $1.5 billion in assets.        CEO Compensation at Foundations with more than $1.5 billion in assets (n = 36, overlaps with above) \n\n 25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile Base pay $561,000 $671,500 $763,100 Total compensation $675,600 $781,100 $981,500  Notes:   ● These data are not adjusted for cost--of--living, although most of the foundations are based in large American cities. ● The 36 foundations surveyed with $1.5 billion in assets or more had a median grants payout of $124 million. We chose this tier because its median payout was the closest to GiveWell's money moved. GiveWell's estimate of total money directed to charities in 2016 is $118,594,102.1 The next tier down in the compensation survey we relied on had a median annual grants payout of $32 million. ● Details of this data and definitions are available in Exhibit A.  Research not-for-profits  We pulled the available staff compensation information from nine research or charity-review-oriented not-for-profits: Innovations for Poverty Action, IDinsight, Evidence Action, Center for Global Development, Center for Effective Philanthropy, Urban Institute, Guidestar, Charity Navigator, and Results for Development.   Here are the summary statistics for the salaries of the president, CEO, or Executive Director at those organizations in their 2015 990s:  Compensation for Presidents and/or CEOs at 9 orgs from 2016 990s  25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile Base pay $201,647 $235,459 $337,149 Total compensation $213,223 $265,402 $383,544  Notes: ● We have not adjusted for cost--of--living. ● Evidence Action’s CEO served until November 2016. We extrapolated his published salary to cover all twelve months of 2016. ● Details of this data are available in Exhibit B.  Academics                                                   1 Source: GiveWell Metrics Report – 2016 Annual Review \n\nWe think that professors at UC Berkeley make for good comparisons because Berkeley is a well-regarded school (and therefore ought to give some indication of what sort of pay attracts top tier intellectuals in a not-for-profit environment), is public (so salary information is publicly available), and is located in the Bay Area.  We believe that economics professors make the most appropriate comparison for Elie within this data set.  Below are summary statistics for the compensation of Berkeley economics professors in 2016.   Compensation for UC Berkeley economics professors in 2016  (n = 44)  25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile Base pay $165,725 $250,648 $287,940 Total compensation $206,405 $308,025 $347,620    There were nine professors who received their BAs in 2004 or later (the year Elie graduated from college):  BA year Gross Pay 2010 $192,310 2010 $204,869 2009 $206,917 2008 $204,721 2006 $191,475 2005 $195,633 2004 $195,800 2004 $227,380 2004 $219,448  Note that professors typically have ~3 months per year, and ~1 day per week during the remaining months, for pursuing side engagements, including paid ones. Elie works full--time at GiveWell.  Details of this data are available in Exhibit B. \n\nOpen Philanthropy compensation [Redacted]  Compensation proposal  We propose a compensation raise for Elie from $200,000 to $250,000. Elie currently receives no non-salary compensation from GiveWell.  "

All expenses \nexceeding such amounts shall be approved by the audit committee of the board.  \n \nThe Ex ecutive Director may delegate authority to sign checks and notes to any employee of GiveWell. The \nExecutive Director remains responsible for ensuring that all such checks and notes follow the applicable \nrequirements laid out elsewhere in these By -Laws.  \n \n4. Compensation Approval Policies  \n \nSection 1. Compensation Approval Policies   \n \nA voting member of the governing board who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the \ncorporation for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member's compensation.  \n \nA voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives \ncompensation, directly or indirectly, from the corporation for services is precluded from voting on matters \npertaining to that member's compensation.  \n \nNo voting member of the governing board or any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation \nmatters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the corporation, either individually or \ncollectively, is prohibited from providing information to any committee regarding compensation.  \n \nWhen appr oving compensation for directors, officers and employees, contractors, and any other \ncompensation contract or arrangement, in addition to complying with the corporation’s conflict of interest \nrequirements and policies, the board or a duly constituted compe nsation committee of the board shall also \ncomply with the following additional requirements and procedures:  \n \na. The terms of compensation shall be approved by the board or compensation committee prior to the first \npayment of compensation,  \n \nb. All members  of the board or compensation committee who approve compensation arrangements must \nnot have a conflict of interest with respect to the compensation arrangement as specified in IRS \nRegulation Section 53.4958 -6(c)(iii), which generally requires that each boa rd member or committee \nmember approving a compensation arrangement between this organization and a \"disqualified person\" \n(as defined in Section 4958(f)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code and as amplified by Section 53.4958 -3 \nof the IRS Regulations):  \n\n \n1. is n ot the person who is the subject of the compensation arrangement, or a family member of such \nperson;  \n \n2. is not in an employment relationship subject to the direction or control of the person who is the subject \nof the compensation arrangement;  \n \n3. does not receive compensation or other payments subject to approval by the person who is the subject of \nthe compensation arrangement;  \n \n4. has no material financial interest affected by the compensation arrangement; and  \n \n5. does not approve a transaction pr oviding economic benefits to the person who is the subject of the \ncompensation arrangement, who in turn has approved or will approve a transaction providing benefits to \nthe board or committee member.  \n \nc. The board or compensation committee shall obtain an d rely upon appropriate data as to comparability \nprior to approving the terms of compensation. Appropriate data may include the following:  \n \n1. Compensation levels paid by similarly situated organizations, both taxable and tax -exempt, for \nfunctionally comp arable positions. \"Similarly situated\" organizations are those of a similar size, purpose, \nand with similar resources.  \n \n2. The availability of similar services in the geographic area of this organization.  \n \n3. Current compensation surveys compiled by indepe ndent firms.  \n \n4. Actual written offers from similar institutions competing for the services of the person who is the \nsubject of the compensation arrangement.  \n \nAs allowed by IRS Regulation 4958 -6, if this organization has average annual gross receipts (inc luding \ncontributions) for its three prior tax years of less than $1 million, the board or compensation committee \nwill have obtained and relied upon appropriate data as to comparability if it obtains and relies upon data \non compensation paid by three compar able organizations in the same or similar communities for similar \nservices.  \n \nd. The terms of compensation and the basis for approving them shall be recorded in written minutes of the \nmeeting of the board or compensation committee that approved the compens ation. Such documentation \nshall include:  \n \n1. The terms of the compensation arrangement and the date it was approved.  \n \n2. The members of the board or compensation committee who were present during debate on the \ntransaction, those who voted on it, and the v otes cast by each board or committee member.  \n \n3. The comparability data obtained and relied upon and how the data was obtained.  \n \n\n4. If the board or compensation committee determines that reasonable compensation for a specific position \nin this organization or for providing services under any other compensation arrangement with this \norganization is higher or lower than the range of comparability data obtained, the board or committee \nshall record in the minutes of the meeting the basis for its determination.  \n \n5. If the board or committee makes adjustments to  comparability data due to geographic area or other \nspecific conditions, these adjustments and the reasons for them shall be recorded in the minutes of the \nboard or committee meeting.  \n \n6. Any actions taken with respect to determining if a board or committ ee member had a conflict of \ninterest with respect to the compensation arrangement, and if so, actions taken to make sure the member \nwith the conflict of interest did not affect or participate in the approval of the transaction (for example, a \nnotation in t he records that after a finding of conflict of interest by a member, the member with the conflict \nof interest was asked to, and did, leave the meeting prior to a discussion of the compensation arrangement \nand a taking of the votes to approve the arrangemen t).  \n \n7. The minutes of board or committee meetings at which compensation arrangements are approved must \nbe prepared before the later of the date of the next board or committee meeting or 60 days after the final \nactions of the board or committee are taken with respect to the approval of the compensation \narrangements. The minutes must be reviewed and approved by the board and committee as reasonable, \naccurate, and complete within a reasonable period thereafter, normally prior to or at the next board or \ncommi ttee meeting following final action on the arrangement by the board or committee.  \n \nSection 2. Annual Statements   \n \nEach director, principal officer, and member of a committee with governing board delegated powers shall \nannually sign a statement which affir ms such person:  \na. has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,  \nb. has read and understands the policy,  \nc. has agreed to comply with the policy, and  \nd. understands the corporation is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax exemp tion it must \nengage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax -exempt purposes.  \n \nSection 3. Periodic Reviews   \n \nTo ensure the corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage \nin activities that c ould jeopardize its tax -exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic \nreviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:  \na. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey \ninformation, and the result of arm's -length bargaining.  \nb. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to \nthe corporation's written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for \ngoods an d services, further charitable purposes, and do not result in inurement, impermissible private \nbenefit, or in an excess benefit transaction.  \n \nSection 4. Use of Outside Experts   \n \n\nWhen conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Section 3, the corporation may, but need not, use \noutside advisors. If outside experts are used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its \nresponsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are  conducted.  \n \nFURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board hereby authorizes the officers of GiveWell to do and \nperform all such further acts and to execute such documents as shall be necessary or advisable in \norder to carry out the foregoing resolutions.  \n \n \nThese actions collectively taken by the board of directors on April 30, 2019.

Whitney’s team, for example, is responsible for\nprocessing donations to our recommended charities, and for\npreparing GiveWell to increase the size of its staﬀ. Ben is\nleading experiments to evaluate diﬀerent ways we might\nincrease the amount of funding we direct to our top charities\nvia marketing and outreach.\nFull details of our performance against our 2018 outreach and\noperations goals are here.\nResearch\nWe completed several projects that improved the quality of our\ncost-eﬀectiveness estimates and how we write about them, andHow GiveWell’s\nresearch is\nevolving\nSchedule a quick\ncall to make\ngiving easier\nDecember 2018\nopen thread\nStaff members’\npersonal\ndonations for\ngiving season\n2018\nWe’ve added\nmore options for\ncryptocurrency\ndonors\nResponse to\nconcerns about\nGiveWell’s\nspillovers\nanalysis\nFOLLOW US:\nRecent CommentsAdded senior hires in operations and outreach: a\nDirector of Operations (Whitney Shinkle) and Head of\nGrowth (Ben Bateman)..\nContinued to improve and expand our core research\nproduct, completing new intervention reports,\ndeepening our analysis for several key inputs into our\ncost-eﬀectiveness model, and providing more\ntransparent explanations for how we decided to allocate\nfunds between top charities..\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Review of GiveW ell's work in 2018 - The GiveW ell Blog\nhttps://blog.givewell.or g/?p=1 1977&preview=true 3/5that we believe led to be\u0000er decisions about where to allocate\nfunds. For example, we made a major change to how we\ncalculate worm intensity in the areas where our top charities\nwork.\nWe also improved our transparency about these decisions,\nbreaking our blog posts announcing our top charities into\ncomponent parts to make them easier to follow (see 1, 2, and 3)\nand delving into more detail on our principles and funding gap\nanalyses.\nWe published ﬁve new intervention reports, two of which were\non the evidence for community-based management of acute\nmalnutrition and syphilis screening and treatment during\npregnancy, and recommended ﬁve new GiveWell Incubation\nGrants and two grant renewals.

Did we\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Progress in 2018\nhttps://www .givewell.or g/print/node/3088 2/8post:\ngoalachieve\nthis\ngoal?\nFind\nnew top\ncharities\nthat\nmeet\nour\ncurrent\ncriteria(i) completing intervention reports for at least two interventions we think are\nlikely to result in GiveW ell top charities by the end of 2019, (ii) considering\nrenewal of GiveW ell Incubation Grants to current grantee organizations that\nmay become top charities in the future and making new Incubation Grants,\nand (iii) developing and maintaining high-quality relationships with charities,\nfunders, and inﬂuencers in the global health and development community; on\n(iii), we set speciﬁc goals of:\nhaving at least one call or meeting with at least 60 dif ferent charities that\nwe have not recommended or made an Incubation Grant to and at least\n100 such calls or meetings in total.\nhaving at least ﬁve multi-program organizations with budgets of more\nthan $50 million annually express interest in being considered for our\ntop charity recommendation for a speciﬁc, promising program, if we\ninvite them to apply\nprioritizing research work beyond an initial, brief evidence assessment\non at least ﬁve interventions that we became aware of through\nprofessional networks.(i) Yes\n(in spirit)\n(ii) Yes\n(iii) No\nIn the case of (i), we evaluated and published reports on ﬁve new programs: community-based\nmanagement of acute malnutrition , syphilis screening and treatment during pregnancy ,\nbreastfeeding promotion , Alive & Thrive , and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during\npregnancy . We also named Georgetown University Initiative on Innovation, Development, and\nEvaluation's Zusha! Road Safety Campaign  as a standout charity .\nIn the case of (ii), we made ﬁve new Incubation Grants: Evidence Action Beta’ s work on iron and\nfolic acid supplementation , Nick Otis’ s forecasting research , Fortify Health , Evidence Action Beta’ s\nincubator , and J-PAL’s Innovation in Government Initiative . We also completed renewals for two\nIncubation Grants: IDinsight’ s embedded team  and phase 2 of Evidence Action Beta’ s work on iron\nand folic acid supplementation .\nIn the case of (iii), we decided to deprioritize this goal. W e are no longer pursuing this as an\nindependent goal, and plan to develop relationships in service of other major goals.\n3. Improve our internal processes to support the above goals\n2018 post: goal 2018 post: What does success look like?Did we\nachieve\nthis\ngoal?\nImprove our internal\nprocesses to\nsupport the above\ngoalsWe plan to continue to [(i)] delegate signiﬁcant parts of our top\ncharity update process to non-management staf f and [(ii)] to\nimprove our year-end process for making recommendations.(i)\nPartially\n(ii) Yes\n(in spirit)\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Progress in 2018\nhttps://www .givewell.or g/print/node/3088 3/8Related to goal (i), we signiﬁcantly reduced the amount of senior staf f time spent on work related to\ntop charity updates. Newer and more junior staf f took on a large amount of work related to top\ncharity updates , cost-ef fectiveness analyses , tracking new academic evidence, updating our\nintervention reports , and managing conversation notes .\nRelated to goal (ii), we made signiﬁcant improvements to our year-end process for making charity\nrecommendations. W e failed to meet two internal deadlines we set for completing intervention-\nrelated work and top charity work, though we did publish many of our top charity reviews well in\nadvance of our external deadline, which left more time for staf f engagement with our\nrecommendations this year . This enabled us to better vet and communicate about our conclusions.\n4. Continue following our top charities and address priority questions\n2018 post:\ngoal2018 post: What does success look like?Did we\nachieve\nthis\ngoal?\nContinue\nfollowing our top\ncharities and\naddress priority\nquestionsWe are devoting fewer resources than we have in the past to top\ncharity updates. W e plan to continue gathering up-to-date information\nto allow us to make high-quality allocation decisions for giving\nseason, and to answer a small number of high-priority questions.Yes\nWe made important updates to our understanding of our top charities and the interventions they\nimplement. These included:\nMaking a major change to how we calculate worm intensity  in the areas where our top\ncharities that implement deworming programs work.\nBeginning to account for the potential long-term development beneﬁts  of vitamin A\nsupplementation in our cost-ef fectiveness model, in order to be more consistent with the\napproach we take for our other priority programs.\nAssessing new research on the potential spillover ef fects of cash transfers .\nUpdating our views on how successful several top charities have been in collecting information\nabout the reach and ef fectiveness of their programs (their monitoring data). For Helen Keller\nInternational's vitamin A supplementation program, Malaria Consortium's seasonal malaria\nchemoprevention program, and Sightsavers' deworming program, our conﬁdence in their\nmonitoring data increased. For the Against Malaria Foundation and Evidence Action's Deworm\nthe W orld Initiative, our conﬁdence in the consistency with which they collect and share\nmonitoring data decreased somewhat.\nIncorporating new information from our top charities on their past spending, results achieved,\nand future plans to model how best to allocate additional funding among our top charities to\nmaximize cost-ef fectiveness.\n5.

No\nWe did not publish reviews of any new potential top charities in 2018, outside of GiveW ell Incubation\nGrant recipients, which may be potential future top charities, but are outside of the scope of what\nthis goal was intended to capture.\nOutreach\nWe wrote about our 2018 outreach goals here.\n1. Hire a Head of Growth\n2018 post: goal2018 post: What does success look\nlike?Did we achieve this\ngoal?\nHire a Head of\nGrowth.Hire a Head of Growth Yes\nWe hired Ben Bateman as GiveW ell's Head of Growth. He joined GiveW ell in June 2018.\n2. Improve the post-donation experience\n2018\npost:\ngoal2018 post: What does success look like?Did we\nachieve\nthis\ngoal?\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Progress in 2018\nhttps://www .givewell.or g/print/node/3088 5/8Improve\nthe post-\ndonation\nexperience.Signiﬁcantly improve our process for post-donation follow-up before giving\nseason 2018.\nAt this point, we’re still in the earliest stages of ﬁguring out how we’ll do\nthis, so we don’t have concrete goals for the year beyond ﬁnalizing our\nplan in the next few months. Our stretch goal for the year is to succeed in\nachieving measured improvement in our dollar retention rate/lifetime value\nof each donor .No\nWe made signiﬁcant progress on developing our framework for donor retention, including by\ncleaning up the data we have so we can more reliably send mass emails and considering our\noutreach strategies. W e also completed an email ﬂow to encourage donors to give by year-end.\nHowever , we have yet to ﬁgure out how to best serve most of our donors, and we don't believe the\nwork we did in 2018 will signiﬁcantly change our donor retention.\n3. Secondary: Continue advertising on podcasts\n2018 post: goal 2018 post: What does success look like?Did we\nachieve this\ngoal?\nSecondary goal: Continue\nadvertising on podcasts.Advertise on new podcasts and measure results\nto decide how much to spend in 2019.Yes\nIn 2018, we spent ~$245,000 on podcast advertising, up from ~$90,000 in 2017 , on podcast ads.\nWe spent more in part due to higher prices to advertise on the same podcasts as last year , and also\nbecause we were experimenting with new podcasts that targeted wider audiences. W e advertised\non The Ezra Klein Show , The W eeds, FiveThirtyEight Politics, V ery Bad Wizards, Science Vs.,\nRadiolab, and Rationally Speaking.\nThe ads we ran in 2018 had signiﬁcantly lower directly-measured returns than the ads in 2017\n(~45% vs. ~100% in 2017). Some loss of ROI may be due to large donors migrating to our check\nand wire transfer forms (which is how we recommend larger donors give ), which don't include the\nquestion \"where did you hear about GiveW ell?\" (and so thus would not be credited to podcast\nadvertising); we would guess this doesn't account for the full picture. Podcast ad prices were also\nhigher this year overall and podcasts may have been running more ads in general, which may have\ncontributed to worse ROI overall if each individual ad was less ef fective.\n4. Secondary: Receive coverage in major news outlets\n2018 post: goal 2018 post: What does success look like?Did we\nachieve this\ngoal?\nSecondary goal: Receive\ncoverage in major news\noutlets.Pitch major news outlets on at least ﬁve stories\nin total and get at least one story covered.No\nWe did not prioritize pitching major media on coverage of GiveW ell, although we did receive\ncoverage in major news outlets, including The New Y ork T imes , Vox, and The Economist .\n5.

Yes\nCatherine Hollander , a research analyst focused on outreach at GiveW ell, spoke at three effective\naltruism (EA)  conferences in 2018: in San Francisco , Melbourne, and London . She also attended\ntwo EA retreats, and deepened her relationships with her counterparts at EA organizations.\nAdditional GiveW ell staf f attended the EA conferences in San Francisco and London, and had\ncontact with EA organizations at various points in the year .\nOperations\nWe wrote about our 2018 operations goals here.\n1. Appoint a new Director of Operations (complete)\n2018 post: goal2018 post:\nWhat does\nsuccess\nlook like?Did we\nachieve\nthis\ngoal?\nAppoint a new Director of Operations (complete). In April 2018, we hired\nWhitney Shinkle as our new Director of Operations. Between January\nand April 2018, Natalie Crispin served as our interim Director of\nOperations.Appoint a\nnew Director\nof Operations.Yes\nWhitney Shinkle joined GiveW ell as Director of Operations in April 2018.\n2. Prepare our systems for major growth in outreach\n2018 post: goal2018 post: What\ndoes success look\nlike?Did we\nachieve\nthis goal?\nPrepare our systems for major growth in outreach, which we\nexpect to lead to increases in spending, staf f, and\ndonations.Not speciﬁed. Partially\nSpending (ﬁnance) . We made several major improvements to our ﬁnance work in 2018, including\nconsolidating our schedule and accounting processes with our bookkeeping ﬁrm and setting a more\naggressive timeline for major annual ﬁnancial milestones with our tax and audit partners; initiating\nproduction of new metrics to track our accounting processes and organizational ﬁnancial health; and\nexecuting the ﬁrst draft of a ﬁnancial policy and procedures guide to codify and record our ﬁnance\npractices (this provides clarity , protection, and consistency across vendors, personnel, and\nregulatory changes).\nDonations . We continue to explore options to increase donations-processing efﬁciency , but we didn't\nidentify a comprehensive approach that we're conﬁdent would support 4-10x growth in volume of\ndonations. W e made or are testing individual improvements to our data entry and donations-\nprocessing systems, which have anecdotally had positive results.\n3.

Yes\nWe maintained our critical operations in 2018. These include, but aren't limited to:\nProcessing donations we receive from donors and responding to questions related to\ndonations in a timely manner .\nAddressing legal and governance issues to stay in compliance with nonproﬁt laws and satisfy\ninternal due diligence questions.\nMaintaining a clean, efﬁcient professional workspace.\nHiring and onboarding new staf f to serve key roles at GiveW ell.\nHosting events to encourage staf f cohesion.\n4.

Our goal is to have 3-5 signed oﬀer le\u0000ers in hand from\nnew research staﬀ by the end of 2019.\nWe’re hoping to that additional research capacity will enable us\nto expand the scope of GiveWell’s research, with the aim of\nﬁnding opportunities that are more cost-eﬀective than our\ncurrent top charities. We’re planning to roughly double the size\nof the research team over the next few years.\nOutreach experimentation\nWe plan to expand our outreach to current and potential\ndonors going forward, with the aim of increasing the amount of\nmoney we direct to our recommended charities. As part of this\nwork, we recently hired Stephanie Stojanovic as our ﬁrst Major\nGi\u0000s Oﬃcer. Our goal is to decide by the end of the 1st quarter\nof 2020 whether to scale our staﬀ capacity further in the area of\nmajor gi\u0000s, based on Stephanie’s initial work.[1]\nWe’re also planning to conduct experiments in 2019 related to\nhow we message about our work to reach more people. These\nexperiments could include work on search engine optimization\nand building landing pages that aim to communicate what\nGiveWell does and why it’s valuable, among other possibilities.\nWe expect to have results by early 2020, as the bulk of donations\nwe receive are made in December.\nFinally, we’re planning to search for a Director of Outreach to\noversee work across outreach domains (including major gi\u0000s,\ndonor retention, advertising, marketing, and wri\u0000en\ncommunications).

We plan to look into several new\nareas in 2019, including public health regulation and possible\npaths to support government aid agencies.\nThis work is new for GiveWell, and as noted in our 2018 review\npost, we failed to make as much progress as we hoped in 2018 on\nour work on public health regulation. In 2019, we’re aiming to\nget substantially closer to the point where we have the staﬀ\nstructure to support grantmaking in new areas, though given\nhow early we are in this work, we don’t yet have concrete goals\nwe’re conﬁdent that we’ll achieve.\nA stretch goal for 2019 is to se\u0000le on a structure that we believe\nwill support grantmaking in public health regulation and begin\nmaking grants in that area.\nWe also plan to continue our investigation into possible paths to\nsupport government aid agencies; in particular, we plan to\ncomplete an investigation into an opportunity to do so in the\narea of results-based ﬁnancing.\nImproving GiveWell’s organizational\nstrength\nWe expect to need additional operations capacity to maintain\ncritical functions as GiveWell grows and to improve the\norganization going forward.

In late 2018 Garrell created and conducted an anonymous 360° review of Elie that surveyed six of Elie’s direct reports from the senior staff.   Overall, the review of Elie’s management and GiveWell’s status were positive. No major areas of concern were raised. Several consistent areas for improvement were noted.  Elie and Scott have discussed and are working on a plan to address the following identified areas for improvement:  ● Listening  ● Delegation  ● Inspirational Leadership   The detailed responses from staff are available in the following document (anonymous and with staff permission).

Periodic Review To ensure the corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:  a. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's-length bargaining.  b. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to the corporation's written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes, and do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit, or in an excess benefit transaction.  Past board precedent also requires the GiveWell board to annually review GiveWell’s:  • Roster of directors and officers • Mission and vision statements • Document retention and destruction policy • Insurance coverage    Review Materials A. Management Statements i. Conflict of interest forms All directors and officers have been provided with conflict of interest statements for 2019.

Record retention  Clear Fund’s records are retained, in either electronic or paper format,  according to the schedule below, in compliance with government, legal, and funders’ requirements. When there is a conflict between federal, state and local record retention requirements, the longer retention period prevails. Certain important records, as determined by the Board, will be retained permanently, even if their retention is not required by law.  Record destruction  Once the retention period has expired, The Clear Fund may destroy the records in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of its contents. The Board of Directors approves all destruction of records prior to commencement.  Record destruction is performed under the direction of the Executive Director, who is responsible for maintaining all Certificates of Destruction.  Upon receipt of any legal notice, all record destruction will cease until the end of the investigation, if any.  Review of policy  Record retention requirements are reviewed annually with the Board and independent auditors to determine any necessary changes.

          "text": "GiveWell's recent progress and future plans  \n \n \nWhat is GiveWell's mission?  \nWhat are our major areas of growth?  \nHow are we moving towards these in 2019?  \nWhat did we do in 2018?  \n2018 money moved  \n2018 staff departures  \nResearch was especially capacity constrained in 2018.  \nWhat did not go well in 2018?  \n \nWhat is GiveWell's mission?  \n \nGiveWell's mission is to find outstanding giving opportunities and publish the full details of our \nanalysis to help donors decide where to give.  \n \nWe accomplish our mission by finding the most cost -effective giving opportunities we can and \ndirecting as much money as possible to those recommendations (our money moved).  \n \nWhat are ou r major areas of growth?  \n  \nThey are:  \n  \n● Increasing money moved.  We're working to significantly increase the amount of money \nmoved.  \n○ By metrics year 2022 (i.e., February 2022 -January 2023), annually move $100 \nmillion ex -Good Ventures to our recommendations. This will mean nearly $200 \nmillion in total money moved and that we're the 2nd (or nearly the 2nd) largest \nprivate funder of global health and development.  \n● Building research capacity. We're working to build up the capacity and capabilities  of \nour research team.  \n○ In the next few years, we're planning to have a research team of at least 30 \npeople; we are currently 16. We plan to add 3 additional research managers (for \na total of 5) and a Research Director to lead the team. This capacity will e nable \nus to achieve the goals below.  \n● Researching new areas. We're expanding the scope of our research to consider \nopportunities that we believe are higher impact -per-dollar but rely on less robust \nevidence.  \n○ We aim to direct a significant amount of funding (~$25 million+ / year) to giving \nopportunities that we believe are significantly more cost -effective (~3x) than \n\nwhere we would otherwise direct our marginal dollar. We expect these \nopportunities to be in policy.  \n● Improving research transparency. We intend t o significantly improve the legibility of \nour process and conclusions to the outside world.  \n○ We plan to publish our conclusions about charities and programs that we've \nresearched. We plan to have and share conclusions about programs (e.g., \neducation) and an swer questions (e.g., how should we value health systems \nstrengthening) that donors care about.  \n● Influencing aid agencies. We are working to expand the scope of our work to influence \nand improve the spending of government donors who collectively move tens o f billions of \ndollars annually to global health and development.  \n○ This area is very new so we're not sure what represents a reasonable target. The \ntype of goal we will have is to either move a significant amount of funding \n(~$100m in annual funding) from g overnment aid agencies to our priority \nprograms or significantly improve the cost -effectiveness of a larger pool of \nfunding (~$500m by a factor of 2).  \n● Building a strong organization. We're expanding our operations team to support the \nactivities of a signif icantly larger organization.  \n○ We see emerging needs in HR and finance due to our larger size. We retained \nDavid Mozaffarian as a consulting CFO to advise us on ongoing priorities in \nfinance  \n○ We intend to hire two new full -time staff members on the Operations  team.  \n○ We're putting time into improving our onboarding, formalizing a regular cycle for \nstaff feedback and defining our core values.  \n \nThe spreadsheet in this footnote shows the progress we hope to make each year towards these \nhigh-level goals.1 \n \nHow are w e moving towards these in 2019?  \n \nIn 2019, we are working towards these goals by:  \n \n● Increasing money moved.  \n○ Hiring a VP Marketing to lead the outreach team. In 2019, we believe there's a \n50% chance we make this hire.  \n○ We hired Steph Stojanovic, who started Ju ne 1st as a Major GIfts Officer. She's \nfocused on increasing donations from existing large donors. In 2019, Steph's \ngoal is to move an additional $1 -2 million.  \n○ Ben Bateman, our Head of Growth, is focused on finding and converting new \ndonors. In 2019, Ben's  goal is to move an additional $1 -2 million.  \n                                                 \n1 This spreadsheet is still a work in progress. The current version is our first draft. It doesn't contain \neverything we want it to: for example, we have to flesh out the details and progress of our operations \nplan, and we haven't prioritized pres enting it in an easy -to-consume way. There is no need to review it, \nbut if you'd like to you can see it here. \n\n● Building research capacity.  We plan to add a total of 5 additional people to the team in \n2019:  \n○ Two additional team members are starting in September: Alex Cohen as a Senior \nFellow and Alicia Weng as a Research Analyst. (Michael Eddy started in June.)  \n○ We're also aiming to add another Senior RA and two Content Editors.  \n○ In addition, we're aiming to add one more personnel manager; currently, Josh \nand Natalie are the only two personnel managers on the research team.  \n● Researching new areas.  \n○ Exploring public health regulation (e.g., lead regulation, tobacco taxation) to \nidentify important, neglected areas that might be susceptible to philanthropic \ninvestment.  \n○ In 2019, we aim to complete our high -level expl oration of policy areas and to \ndecide whether to prioritize alcohol as a cause area, which would lead us to \nbegin a search for a program officer, focused on alcohol policy.  \n● Improving research transparency.  We don't plan to make significant progress against  \nthis goal in 2019. We expect to make more progress in 2020, when we have more \ncapacity.  \n● Influencing aid agencies.  We hired Michael Eddy on a 6 -month contract to explore \nopportunities with aid agencies.  \n● Building a strong organization. We're expanding our o perations team to support the \nactivities of a significantly larger organization.  \n○ We see emerging needs in HR and finance due to our larger size.  \n \nWhat did we do in 2018?  \n \nIn 2018, we made progress towards these priorities by:  \n \n● Hiring Dan Brown, Tom Sittler, Marinella Capriati, and Amar Radia on the research team  \n● Hiring Ben Bateman as Head of Growth  \n● Hiring Whitney Shinkle as Director of Operations  \n \n2018 money moved  \n \nIn 2018, we moved significantly more money (ex -Good Ventures) than we had in 2017. We \nmoved approximately $65 million in 2018, relative to approximately $45 million in 2017.  \n \nThis increase was mostly driven by two donors giving $15 million more than they had in \nprevious years. We worked hard to maintain and build these donors relationships in 2017 and \n2018 but we would guess that this increase is mostly not attributable to our actions.  \n \nResearch was especially capacity constrained in 2018.  \n \nNatalie was interim Director of Operations during the first half of the year (from the time Sarah \nWard left until Whitney was onboarded), and she was out of parental leave during the 4th \n\nquarter, one of the busiest for the team. Her absence on the research team led to additional \nburden on Josh and James which slowed us down on other priorities.  \n \n "

          "text": "DRAFT Proposal:  \nGiveWell LifeCycle Feedback Program  \nProgram Background  \nOperations Goals  \nGiveWell Operations has the following overarching goals and purpose.  \nTo make Givewell:  \n● A place where top talent wants to work  \n● A place where top talent can work effectively, and  \n● A sector -leading organization that can continue to exist sustainably.  \nFeedback purpose  \nGiveWell considers staff feedback a key (though incomplete) indicator of our success in \nachieving the top two above g oals. GiveWell will solicit staff feedback on an ongoing basis in \norder to assess staff satisfaction and identify potential problems impacting effectiveness that \nrequire attention. We will use this information to identify trends over time and within variou s \nsub-groups of the organization (e.g. individual departments or managed teams)  \nFeedback Priorities  \nOur priorities in soliciting this information are to:  \n● Ensure staff have an opportunity to be heard throughout their entire tenure at GiveWell \nfrom onboardi ng through separation  \n● Provide a mixture of solicitation vehicles to suit various communication styles, comfort \nlevels, and subject matter  \n● Capture both high level trends and actionable/specific  feedback on specific issues  \n● Balance the need for actionable inf ormation with administrative burden on staff to \nadminister or respond to solicitations  \n● Avoid “feedback fatigue” and/or data overload (resulting in non -implementation)  \nFeedback Structure  \nTo meet these competing priorities, GiveWell intends to design a progr am that includes:  \n● Annual and more frequent components  \n● Routine and opportunistic components  \n● Confidential and attributed formats  \n● Comprehensive surveying and nuanced interviewing formats  \n \n\nWe further expect that some of these components will evolve over time as we become more \nproficient in soliciting key information and in tracking this data to discover which methods and \nquestions elicit the most useful information and are most appreciated by staff.  \nProgram Design  \nAll Staff  \nThe following are components of  the program that will be offered in an All -Staff setting or with \nthe expectation that all staff are invited to participate in a joint event.  \nAnnual Components  \n● Annual Flex Survey  \nWhat is it: Once -yearly, confidential survey inquiring into the full range o f employee \nexperiences, including satisfaction with various factors like role, compensation, work -life \nbalance, work environment, manager, project opportunities, etc. This will be \nadministered and analyzed by a professional survey company that provides man y options \nfor customization, multiple levels and forms of data analysis, including data coding, \ncompartmentalization, and personalized debriefing for staff and management. Having a \nrelatively consistent feedback form will also enable us  to easily track tre nds over time.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Management can access data responses and analysis  at all staff, \ndepartment, managed team, and other customized levels of compartmentalization. Senior \nmanagers will review the feedback as a group and managers may review d epartment data \nas a team. A report -out will be presented to All Staff every year. Specific actions will be \ndetermined by management in response to the data.  \n \n● Executive Director Office Hours  \nWhat is it: The E.D. will host a series of open visitation periods  for all staff. Staff may \nsign-up for a 1:1 or small group session. At present, these will likely be offered more than \nonce a year given our small size but the E.D. will formally commit to an annual event.  \n \nHow is it actioned: The executive director will n ote any actionable feedback in an “office \nhours” Asana project and discuss response actions with the Dir. Of Operations or specific \nmanagers as appropriate.  \n \n \nQuarterly Components  \n● Quarterly Meetings  \nWhat is it: All -hands meeting to update staff on GiveWell  strategy and key initiatives and \nprojects. We will be continuing to iterate these into more interactive formats and using \n\nthem as an opportunity to solicit feedback on ongoing initiatives (e.g. diversity) via more \nconcrete inquiries such as straw polls or  upvoting exercises.  \n \nHow is it actioned: The Executive Director and Director of Operations will debrief after \neach meeting to discuss whether ongoing, new or corrective actions are required in \nresponse to the meeting feedback.  \n \n• Quarterly Reminders  \nWhat is it: Givewell sends out a standard document on a quarterly basis with key \nreminders to staff. Staff have to sign off each quarter that they have reviewed the \nreminders. In that document, we reinforce our desire to know about any incidents staff \nmay experience and reiterate options for reporting issues, including reporting directly to \na board member (Holden).  \n \nHow is it actioned: The office manager is responsible for distributing and confirming all \nstaff have signed off. He also solicits any edits to  the document from select managers \nprior to distribution every quarter. The individuals receiving any complaints are \nresponsible for responding to any grievances, including any that might rise to the level of \ntriggering our incident response protocol.  \nRout ine Ongoing Components  \n● After -Action Surveys/Polls  \nWhat is it: employees are asked via anonymous poll to rate all team meetings and various \naspects of social cohesion events. Polls are the bluntest and least intensive form of \nfeedback and are intended to provide a general barometer on the success of an eve nt or \nthe general health of standing meetings. Surveys are slightly more detailed and will be \nused less frequently for the purposes of assessing specific componentsof an event, the \nsuccess of new or changed events, or to get immediate feedback while impres sions are \nfresh in people’s minds.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Event owners will review the feedback and share with the Director of \nOperations, Executive Director, or other staff as appropriate. Combined annual results \nmay be provided to staff when and if that se ems usefully informative.  \nOpportunistic/Ad Hoc Components  \n● Round Tables  \nWhat is it: Round tables consist of opt -in group discussions focused on a specific topic of \ntheme. We will be more intentionally utilizing this format to allow staff with an interest \nin particular initiatives to keep up to date on progress, provide perspectives and input \nduring development stages, and to solicit staff feedback on critical questions or overall \nemployee buy -in and satisfaction.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Round table facilitators  will determine the particular method of \nfeedback for any given round table. This might entail anonymous or attributed polling, \n\nfacilitated discussion, coding comments from meeting minutes, etc. The facilitator will be \nthe primary person responsible for in terpreting and actioning the feedback but may also \ncoordinate with other managers/directors as appropriate.  \n \nEmployee LifeCycle  \nThe following are components of the program that will be universally offered to all staff but \nwould typically be offered in an i ndividual setting, sometimes specific to their passing a \nparticular employment milestone.  \n \nOnboarding Components  \n● Six Week HR Check -In \nWhat is it: This is a dedicated 1:1 conversation between an experienced GiveWell staff \nperson (intentionally not a senior manager; currently Erin Wolff) soliciting feedback on a \ncomprehensive set of topics, including GiveWell as an organization, the onboarding \nprocess, the employee’s manager, the employee’s comfort level, GiveWell culture, etc. \nThere are structured questions as well as organic conversation based on the flow of \nconversation. We plan to add new questions focused on key areas of current interest and \nwill review these annually based on past feedback and the annual survey.  \n \nHow is it actioned: The facilitator takes  notes which are reviewed by the employee and \napproved for release to the Executive Director, Director of Operations, and the \nemployee’s manager. The employee can revise/redact any portion of their comments or \nchoose to not release it to any/all of those i ndividuals. Those that are approved for release \nare reviewed by the above individuals and action can be taken as appropriate in response \nto any specific areas of concern. The Director of Operations also plans to create a \nsimplistic meta -file to collectiviz e responses and review for any trends that may require a \nmore systemic change or correction.  \n \n● First Year Manager Check -Ins (approximately end of: 1 week, 2 week, 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, \n9 mo, 12 mo)  \nWhat is it: Our onboarding process includes a series of dedicated 1:1s intended to ensure \nnew employees receive necessary support during their first year by carving out 1:1 time \nthat is intentionally reflective rather than focused on day -to-day projects. While an \nimportant purpose of these meetings is to provid e the employee with feedback on their \nperformance, we plan to provide more specific guidance to managers on additional key \nobjectives for these meetings and specific topics to check on, particularly regarding \nmanager -report relations.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Managers have the primary responsibility for acting on the feedback \nshared in these meetings though they may seek additional guidance from other managers \nor staff.  \n\nTenure Components  \n(i.e. components offered routinely throughout an employee’s tenure at Giv eWell)  \n● Bi-Annual Reviews  \nWhat is it: GiveWell conducts performance reviews with all staff twice a year. These are \nhandled as 1:1 meetings between the employee and his/her manager. Although the \nmajority of this meeting is dedicated to employee performance, there is a dedicated \nquestion regarding things GiveWell, or GiveWell management, could do better. Once a \nyear staff are also asked to provide feedback on their peers (any GiveWell staff person). \nWe propose adding another dedicated question regarding improv ements the employees \nmanager could make to help the employee succeed or improve. We also propose \ncollectivizing the staff responses regarding general GiveWell improvements in order for \nmanagement to have a running, high level view of any trends, new issues , etc.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Individual performance reviews and feedback are reviewed by a \nperson’s manager and the Executive Director. They mutually agree on any action plans \nthat need to be implemented for the individual employees and/or manager. The Dire ctor \nof Operations would be responsible to updating and analyzing the meta -file on general \nfeedback and proposing any actions to be taken at an organizational level.   \n \n● Manager 360 Reviews (may be incorporated into the Annual Survey - TBD)  \nWhat is it: Curr ently GiveWell does not have a systematic process for gathering feedback \non managers. Certain managers have instituted informal procedures for gathering \nfeedback from their direct reports, but this is not universal or routine. We propose to \ninitiate some f orm of manager review which may be implemented via Flex’s annual \nreview or may be an independent process (tbd). In either case it will cover a broad range \nof manager strengths and weaknesses, employee comfort with their manager, and \nproposed improvements.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Managers would be responsible for reviewing their results with the \nDirector of Operations and the Executive Director and developing personal action plans \nas needed. They would also provide, at minimum, a high -level summary of the feedb ack \nto their reports as well as steps being taken to respond to the feedback.  \n \n● Remote Worker Check -Ins \nWhat is it: The Director of Operations currently conducts periodic check -ins with remote \nstaff. These are typically phone calls or video calls approximat ely every quarter \n(individual staff are contacted on a rotating basis). We plan to add a few dedicated \nquestions to these check -ins, focused on issues specific to remote staff.  \n \nHow is it actioned: The Director of Operations will be responsible for archivi ng and \nanalyzing the feedback from these meetings and proposing any potential actions to \nemployee managers or the Executive Director in response to individual circumstances or \nmore general remote -staff issues.  \n \n● Manager Handoff Check -Ins \n\nWhat is it: When em ployees change to a new manager, the former and new manager \njointly administer a manager handoff process in Asana. One step in this process requires \nmanagers to check -in with their former reports several weeks after the handoff has been \nimplemented. We pro pose to offer managers more specific guidance about key \nconsiderations to check in on during these meetings.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Former and new managers would be jointly responsible for sharing \ninformation to facilitate a smooth handover and if there are any problems, the managers \nwill be responsible for working collaboratively to develop next steps, involving other \nparties as appropriate if needed (e.g. Director of Operations or Executive Director). The \nDirector of Operations is responsible for auditing A sana to ensure that the handoff project \nwas completed.  \n \n● Weekly 1:1s  \nWhat is it: Managers host weekly 1:1s with their direct reports. These meetings vary by \nindividual. Given the diversity and potential effort to apply any change across the board \nwe are not  recommending any specific change to these meetings. It is noted here for \nreference since many managers receive a significant number of insights through these \ndiscussions.  \n \nSeparation Components  \n● Exit Interview  \nWhat is it: GiveWell requests all separating employees to participate in an exit interview \nprior to departing. This is a dedicated 1:1 conversation facilitated by a person of their \nchoice (or the Director of Operations or Erin Wolff if the employee has no preference). \nThe interviewer solic its feedback on a broad spectrum of questions about the employee’s \nexperience at GiveWell.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Exit interviews are approved for distribution by the employee. They \nautomatically are provided to the employee’s manager, the Director of Operat ions, and \nthe Executive Director. Similar to the 6 -week HR talk, we propose to add the information \nfrom these interviews into a meta file to enable better analysis and tracking of the  \nfeedback from this tool.  \n \n \n \n \n\nCharacteristic Matrix  \n  Component characte ristics  \nComponent  Comprehensive  Focused  Nuanced \nor \nDetailed  Confidential  Attributed  Admin  \nBurden  \nAnnual \nSurvey  Yes   Detailed  Yes   Medium  \nQuarterly \nMeetings    Yes Nuanced    Yes High  \nAfter Action \nPolls/Survey    Yes   Yes (voluntary\n) Low \nRound \nTables    Yes Nuanced    Yes (depends)  \n6 Week HR \nTalk  Yes   Nuanced    Yes Low \nManager \nSeries      Nuanced \nand \ndetailed    Yes Medium  \nBi-annual \nReviews    Yes Nuanced    Yes High  \nManager 360  Yes (on topic)    Detailed  Yes   ? \nWeekly 1:1      Nuanced \nand \ndetailed    Yes Low-\nMedium  \nExit \nInterviews  Yes   Nuanced    Yes Low \n "

Letter to the Audit Committee from Hood & Strong (auditors)  \nIII. 2018 Audited Financial Statements  \n \n  \n\nI. Comments from the Director of Operations  \n \nThe audit committee ( Tim, Holden, Julia ) unanimously approved the finalization of these \ndocuments for full board review. The only changes to the final documents per that review are  the \nfollowing aesthetic corrections : \n• Correction of a typo Holden noted on page 2 of the letter to the audit commit tee \n• Entering the date of closure into Note 2m of the Financial Statement . This corresponds \nwith the date the document was finalized after committee approval . \n• In Note 4 of the Financial Statement, combining the Net Assets with Donor Restriction of \na) the Ef fective Altruism Foundation and b) Raising for Effective Giving (REG) which \nare actually a single  pool of funds  but which were captured under different  names  in \nSalesforce for a portion of 2018.  \n• In Note 6 of the Financial Statement, correcting a typo that  inaccurately noted a donation \nas being from Open Phil LLC instead of the Open Phil Fund.  \nOnce the full board has approved, these documents will be prepared for public release on our \nwebsite.   \n \nAdditional information f or those not on the audit committee:  \nIn line with the results last year, there were no audit findings. In addition, this year there also are \nno official recommendations, merely updates on the prior years' recommendations.   \n \nI have reviewed the letter and financials and agree with the stateme nts.  \n \nI will draw your attention to one item that is not explicitly outlined in the management letter or \nthe financial statement - the presentation of our Outreach expenses.   \n \nIn general, organization expenses have to be allocated to one of three categories - Program, \nGeneral & Management, or Fundraising (this is most clear if you look at the Statement of \nActivities (p4) and the Statement of Functional Expenses (p6) in the draft financials). At a \nstandard non -profit, most of its Outreach expenses w ould be incurred by the Development team \n(to generate donations for its continued operations & programming) and be considered \nfundraising. At GiveWell, the vast majority of our outreach and the activities of our nascent \nOutreach team are more meaningfully considered education (of donors about our research \nfindings) and grant -related outreach (for other charities). As a result, we allocate a majority of \nthe expenses incurred by the Outreach team to the Program category.   \n \nIn the past, this was really a prett y nominal decision because actual outreach expenses were tiny. \nGiven the significant changes in our outreach plans (hiring folks to an official Outreach team, \ngreatly expanding outreach activities to generate money for Top Charities, etc.) Outreach \nexpense s could increase dramatically in the coming years and this decision takes on more \nweight. We have discussed this with Hood and Strong and they agree that this is the appropriate \nconceptual way to present the Outreach expenses. However, we and they are agre ed that for \nfuture years we will want and need to present a more defined narrative that describes our \ndifferent programs (ie. Research, Education/Outreach, and Grantmaking) and how expenses are \n\nallocated to them. This will have the added advantage of makin g the audited financials a more \nuseful tool generally.   \n \nIn parallel, we will be doing the internal work to ensure that we have appropriately defined \nwhich costs and activities should appropriately be allocated to Program and which constitute \nconventional fundraising (for GiveWell operating funds) and shall be allocated to Fundraising.  \n \nRecommendation  \n1. Approve these documents for public release  \n \nComments  \nI am happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the audit documents or the process.  \n \nPleas e don't hesitate to let me know if you have any other questions/comments.  \nThanks,  \nWhitney  \n \n \n \n\n \n  \n \nTHE CLEAR FUND \nD.B.A. GIVEWELL \n \nDECEMBER  31, 2018 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nREPORT  \n \nTO \n \nTHE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \n\n July 5, 2019  \n \n \nTO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \nTHE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GIVEWELL  \nSan Francisco , California  \n \nWe are pleased to present this report related to our audit of the financial statements of THE CLEAR FUND  \nd.b.a. GIVEWELL (Give Well)  for the year ended December 31, 2018 . This report summarizes certain \nmatters required by professiona l standards to be communicated to you in your oversight responsibility for \nGiveWell’s financial reporting process.   \nThis report is intended solely for the information and use of the Audit Committee, Board of Directors  and \nmanagement , and is not intended t o be, and should not be , used by anyone other than these specified parties. \nIt will be our pleasure to respond to any questions you have about this report. We appreciated the \nopportunity to be of service to GiveWell.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSan Francisco ● San Jose ● San Mateo ● Petaluma  \n\n\nThe Clear Fund d.b.a GiveWell  \n \nReport  to The Audit Committee  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nRequired Communications  1 - 3 \n \n \n \nAttachment:  \n \n \nLetter Communicating Deficiencies in Internal Control  Appendix A  \n \n \n \n\nThe Clear Fund d.b.a GiveWell  \n \nRequired Communications  \n \n \n \n1 Generally accepted auditing standards (AU -C 260, The Auditor’s Communication With Those Charged with \nGovernance)  require the auditor to promote effective two- way communication between the auditor and \nthose charged with governance. Consistent with this requirement, the following summarizes our \nresponsibilities regarding the financial statement audit as well as observ ations arising from our audit that \nare significant and relevant to your responsibility to oversee the financial reporting process.  \n \nArea   Comments  \nOur Responsibilities with R egard to \nthe Financial Statement Audit   Our responsibilities under auditing standards generally \naccepted in the United States of America have been \ndescribed to you in our arrangement letter dated  January 31, \n2019. Our audit of the financial statements does not  relieve \nmanagement or those charged with governance of their \nresponsibilities , which are also described in that letter.  \nOverview of the Planned Scope and \nTiming of the Financial Statement \nAudit   We have issued a separate communication regarding the \nplanned scope and timing of our audit as an attachment to \nour arrangement letter . \nAccounting Policies and Practices   Preferability of Accounting Policies and Practices  \nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, in certain \ncircumstances, management may select among alternative \naccounting practices. In our view, in such circumstances, \nmanagement has selected the preferable accounting \npractice.  \n  Adoption of, or Change in, Accounting Policies  \nManagement has the ultimate responsibility for the \nappropriateness of the accounting pol icies used by \nGiveWell . GiveWell adopted ASU 2016- 14, Presentation \nof Financial Statements of Not -For-Profit Entities, \nbeginning January 1, 2018.  GiveWell did not adopt any \nother significant new accounting policies, nor have there \nbeen any changes in existing significant accounting policies \nduring the current period.  \n  Significant or Unusual Transactions  \nWe did not identify any significant or unusual transactions \nor significant accounting policies in controversial or \nemerging areas for which there is a lack of authoritative \nguidance or consensus . \n\nThe Clear Fund d.b.a GiveWell  \n \nRequired Communications  \n \n \n \n2 Area   Comments  \n  Management’s Judgments and Accounting Estimates  \nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation \nof financial statements and are based upon management’s \ncurrent judgment. The process used by management \nencompasses its knowledge and experience about past and \ncurrent events, and certain assump tions about future events. \nYou may wish to monitor throughout the year the process \nused to determine and record these accounting estimates. \nThe following describes the significant accounting estimate \nreflected in GiveWell ’s December 31, 2018 financial \nstatements:  \n- Functional allocation of expenses – directly \nidentifiable expenses are charged to the related \nprogram or service benefited. Indirect expenses are \nallocated to programs and services based \nprincipally on the percentage of personnel tim e \nspent in each area.  \nGiveWell’s processes for estimates appear reasonable and \nare consistent with industry practice and U.S. GAAP.  \nAudit Adjustments   There were no audit adjustments made to the original trial \nbalance presented to us to begin our audit.  \nUncorrected Misstatements   We are not aware of any uncorrected misstatements other \nthan misstatements that are clearly trivial.  \nDisagreements with Management   We encountered no disagreements with management over \nthe application of significant accounting principles, the \nbasis for management’s judgments on any significant \nmatters, the scope of the audit, or significant disclosures to \nbe included in the financial statements.  \nConsultations with Other \nAccountants   We are not aware of any consultations management had \nwith other accountants about accounting or auditing \nmatters.  \nSignificant Issues Discussed with \nManagement   No other  significant issues arising f rom the audit were \ndiscussed or the subject of correspondence with \nmanagement.   \n\nThe Clear Fund d.b.a GiveWell  \n \nRequired Communications  \n \n \n \n3 Area   Comments  \nSignificant Difficulties Encountered \nin Performing the Audit   We did not encounter any other difficulties in dealing with \nmanagement during the audit . \nSignificant Written Communications \nBetween Management and Our Firm   The only written communications between our Firm and \nmanagement of GiveWell are the representation letter \nprovided to us by management (available upon request) and \na letter reporting control  deficiencies  (attached) .  \n \n\n \n July 5, 2019  \n \n \nTO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \nTHE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GiveWell  \nSan Francisco, California  \n \nIn planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of THE CLEAR FUND d.b.a.  \nGIVEWELL (Give Well)  as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with auditing \nstandards generally accepted in the United States o f America, we considered GiveWell ’s internal control \nover financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in \nthe circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the \npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of GiveWell’s internal control. Accordingly, we do \nnot express an opinion on the effectiveness of GiveWell’s internal control.  \nA deficiency in internal control exists when the design or oper ation of a control does not allow management \nor employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, \nmisstatements on a timely basis. A deficiency in design exists when (a)  a control necessary to meet t he \ncontrol objective is missing, or (b)  an existing control is not properly designed so that, even if the control \noperates as designed, the control objective would not be met. A deficiency in operation exists when a \nproperly designed control does not opera te as designed or when the person performing the control does not \npossess the necessary authority or competence to perform the control effectively.  \nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is \na reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be \nprevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. \nA significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal contr ol that is less \nsevere than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSan Francisco ● San Jose ● San Mateo ● Petaluma  \n\n\nTO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \nTHE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GIVEWELL  \nJuly 5, 2019  \nPage 2 \nAppendix A  Following are descriptions of identified deficienc ies in internal control from the prior year that we \ndetermined did not constitute a significant deficiency or material weakness:  \nSTATUS OF PRIOR YEAR RECOMMENDATIONS (as previously rep orted, along with status update)  \nFinancial Statement Disclosure and Presentation Items  \nObservation  \nTwo key areas of presentation and disclosure in GiveWell’s financial statements are its temporarily \nrestricted net assets activity and the transactions with related parties. While items in both of these areas \nwere properly recorded in the general ledger, the supporting schedules initially provided did contain errors. \nOnce these errors were identified, subsequent drafts were corrected by the contracted accounti ng firm.  \nRecommendation  \nWe suggest that GiveWell ensure that these important areas are appropriately reviewed including greater \nlevel of collaboration between the contracted accounting firm and GiveWell’s management team to ensure \npresentation and disclosure of these items are accurate.  \nStatus  \nThis recommendation has been implemented.  \n  \n\nTO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \nTHE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GIVEWELL  \nJuly 5, 2019  \nPage 3 \nAppendix A   \nNew Not -For-Profit Reporting Requirements  \nGiveWell  will be expected to adopt the new accounting pronouncement, ASU 2016- 14, Not-For-Profit \nEntities (Topic 958): Presentation of Financial Statements of Not -For-Profit Entities  for its year ending \nDecember  31, 2018.  The adoption of this new standard will ne cessitate presentation changes in GiveWell ’s \nfinancial statements and footnotes as follows:  \n \nReporting \nRequirements  Recommended Actions for GiveWell \nNet asset terminology  The current terminology of unrestricted, temporarily and permanently \nrestricted net assets will change to “Net assets with donor restrictions” and “Net \nassets without donor restrictions.” There is no action needed.  This will be a \nrelatively simple wording change, which we will facilitate as the December 31, \n2018 financial statements are drafted.  \nFunctional expenses  Instead of reporting the functional expenses as a supplemental schedule, \nGiveWell  will need to include this as one of the standard statements or as a \nseparate footnote. Additionally, GiveWell  will need to disclose  in a bit more \ndetail, the methodology employed for its functional expense allocations.  \nLiquidity disclosures  GiveWell  will be required to disclose the “financial assets available for general \nexpenditures in the next 12 months”.  This will require GiveWell  to identify its \nfinancial assets available to be used for general expenditure, along with any \nrestrictions or other encum brances that would prevent the assets from being \nused for general expenditures. Additionally, GiveWell  would also need to \ndisclose its short -term cash management policies.   \nWe recommend that GiveWell  begin to compile the narrative language for \nthese polic ies and prepare the worksheets necessary to calculate its financial \nassets available for general expenditure.  \n \nStatus  \nThis recommendation has been implemented.  \n  \n\nTO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \nTHE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GIVEWELL  \nJuly 5, 2019  \nPage 4 \nAppendix A   \nUndeposited Funds Reconciliation  \nObservation  \nWe noted that GiveWell’s  utilizes an “undeposited funds” account within its chart of accounts.  This \naccou nt effectively func tions as a clearing account for contributions not yet deposited into its bank accounts.  \nWe were provided an accounting of all the activity in this account  for the year and performed testing that \ndid not yield any errors (i.e. in our sample of contributions tested were verified that the selected items were \ndeposited in GiveWell’s accounts) but a detailed reconciliation of this account is not performed.  Without \na detailed reconciliation verifying that every contribution that flows through the undeposited fund account \nhas been deposited, it’s possible that errors could go undetected.  \nRecommendation  \nWe recommend that GiveWell perform regular reconciliations for undeposited funds at the same frequency \nand approval process as the cash account reconciliations.  \nStatus  \nThis recommendation has been implemented.  \nFunctional Expense Presentation  \nObservation  \nWe noted that GiveWell has included a line item on its functional expense called “donated goods and \nservices”.  The functional expense presentation should only include natural expense classifications such as \nrent or advertising. \nRecommendation  \nWe recommend that GiveWell  begin to record its in- kind expenses in a manner that allows for these \nexpenses to easily be presented into their respective natural expense categories.   \nStatus  \nGiveWell has  changed its manner of recording its in- kind expenses that now allows for separat e reporting \nof the different type of in- kind expenses incurred but elected to continue to present its in -kind expenses all \ncombined into one line item  on the statement of functional expenses.  \n \nThis letter is intended solely for the information and use of management and GiveWell’s Audit Committee \nand is not intended to be, and should not be, used by anyone other than these specified parties. We appreciate \nserving GiveWell and would be happy to assist you in addressing and implementing any of the suggestions  \nin this letter.  \n \n\n\nTHE CLEAR FUND \nD.B.A. GIVEWELL\nDECEMBER 31, 2018 \nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS ’ REPORT  \nAND \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS  \n\nThe Clear Fund d.b.a.

GIVEWELL \nSan Francisco , California  \n \nReport on the Financial Statements   \nWe have audited the accom pany ing financial statements of THE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GIVEWELL \n(GiveWell ), which comprise the statement of financial position as of December 31 , 2018, and the related \nstatements of activities and changes in net assets, functional  expenses and cash flows fo r the year then \nended, and the related notes to the financial statements.  \nManagement’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements  \nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in \naccordance with account ing principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes \nthe design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair \npresentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatem ent, whether due to fraud or \nerror.  \nAuditor s’ Responsibility   \nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We \nconducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards ge nerally accepted in the United States of \nAmerica. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance \nabout whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.  \nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the am ounts and disclosures in \nthe financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the \nassessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or \nerror. In making those risk assessm ents, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s \npreparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are \nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of \nthe entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating \nthe appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of signifi cant accounting \nestimates made by man agem ent, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  \nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for \nour audit opinion. \n  \nSan Francisco ●  San Jose ●  San Mateo ●  Petaluma  \n\n\n \n2 Opinion  \nIn our opinion, the financial statements r eferred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the \nfinancial position of GiveWell  as of December 31 , 2018, and the changes in its net assets and cash flows \nfor the year then ended, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted  in the United States \nof America.  \nEffect of Adopting New Accounting Standard \nAs described in Note 2, GiveWell adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) \nAccounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016- 14, Not -For-Profit Entities (Topic 958): Presentation of \nFinancial Statements of Not -for-Profit Entities. Accordingly, the accounting change has been \nretrospectively applied to all periods presented  with the exception of the omission of certain information \nas permitted by the ASU . Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter. \nReport on Sum marized Comparative Information  \nWe have p reviously audited GiveWell’s 2017 financial statements, and we expressed an unmodified \naudit opinion on those audited financial state ments in our report dated August 16, 2018.

GiveWell\nStatement of Functional Expenses\nSee accompanying notes to financial statements.\n6\n\nThe Clear  Fund d.b.a. GiveWell \n \nNotes to  Financial Statements  \n \n \n \n7 Note 1 -   Nature of the Organization : \nThe Clear Fund d.b.a. GiveWell (GiveWell) is a nonprofit organization incorporated \nFebruary 22, 2007, under the laws of the State of New York. GiveWell aims to find \noutstanding giving opportunities and publishes the full details of its analysis to help donors \ndecide where to give.  GiveWell also gives grants to charities, to improve incentives for doing \ndemonstrably effective work and sharing information on that work. GiveWell’s office is \nlocated in San Francisco, Califo rnia. \n \nNote 2 -   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies : \na. Basis of Accounting   \nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of \naccounting in accordance with accounting principles  generally accepted in the United \nStates o f America (U.S. GAAP).  \nb. Revenue and Support  \nGiveWell’s primary source of revenue is contributions from individuals and other \norganizations. Contributions and unconditional prom ises to give are recorded at fair  \nvalue and are recognized as revenue when the do nor makes an unconditional promise to \ngive. Donated securities are recorded at fair  value at the time of donation. GiveWell \nreports contributions of cash and other assets as restricted support if they are received \nwith donor stipulations that limit the use  of the donated assets, or if they are designated \nas support for future periods. GiveWell maintains variance power over contributions, \nincluding gifts  that are restricted by donors for specific charities.  \nDonated services are recognized as contributions if the services create or enhance non -\nfinancial assets or if the service require s specialized skills and would otherwise be \npurchased by GiveWell.  \nc. Cash and Cash Equivalents  \nGiveWell  considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or l ess \nwhen purchased to be cash equivalents.  \nd. Equipment and Intangible Assets  \nGiveWell capitalizes equipment  and intangible  asset  acquisitions  over $1,000. \nEquipment and intangible assets are recorded at cost and consist primarily of office \nequipment  and we b development costs. Donated equipment is  recorded at its  estimated \nfair value at the date of donation. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the \nstraight -line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets ranging from \nthree to  five years.  \n\nThe Clear  Fund d.b.a. GiveWell \n \nNotes to  Financial Statements  \n \n \n \n8 e. Grants  \nGrants are expensed following  approv al by the board. Contributions restricted to \nrecommended charities are granted to specific charities net of fees GiveWell paid to \npayment processors (primarily credit card processors), befo re being re leased from \nrestrictions.  Donations restricted by donors to “grants to recommended  charities” \nreceived during 2018 were allocated 56% to Malaria Consortium , 31% to Against \nMalaria Foundation and 13% to Schistosomiasis Control Initiative . The all ocation \npercentage is approv ed by GiveWell’s board of directo rs. \nf. Functional Expenses  \nThe cost of providing the various program and supporting services have been \nsummarized on a functional basis in the statements of activities and changes in net assets, \nand functional  expenses.  \nGrant expense is charged directly to pro gram.   Other directly identifiable expenses are \ncharged to the related program or service benefited. These include salaries and related \nbenefits , professional fees, advertising and travel, which are charg ed to the functional \narea of the employee who incurred the  expense. Employees who pe rformed work in \nmultiple functional areas prorate expenses based on the actual hours worked.  \nOccupancy related expenses are allocated to program and services based on a headcount \nby functional  category. Other indirect expenses, i ncluding those associated with office \nadministration, human resources, finance, general insurance and legal are all allocated to \nmanagement and general.  \ng. Net Assets \nNet assets, revenues, gains, and losses are classified  based on t he existence or absence of \ndonor or grantor imposed restrictions. Accordingly, net assets and changes therein are \nclassified and reported as follows:  \nNet Assets Without Donor Restrictions – Net assets available for use in general \noperations and not s ubject  to donor (or certain grantor) restrictions.  \nNet As sets With Donor Restrictions – Net assets subject to donor - (or certain grantor) \nimposed restrictions. GiveWell’s donor -imposed restrictions are temporary in nature, \nsuch a s those that will b e met b y the passage of time or other events specified by the \ndonor.  \nDonor -imposed restrictions are released when a restriction expires, that is, when the \nstipulated time has elapsed, when the stipulated purpose for which the resource w as \nrestricted has been ful filled , or both. \n\nThe Clear  Fund d.b.a. GiveWell \n \nNotes to  Financial Statements  \n \n \n \n9 h. Use of Estimates \nThe preparation of fina ncial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires \nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect  reported amounts and \ndisclosures. Accordingly, a ctual result s could differ fr om those e stima tes. \ni. Tax-Exempt Status  \nGiveWell is a non -profit orga nization exempt from federal income tax under Section \n501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code  and a similar provision for state taxing \nauthorities. In addition, GiveWell has  been determined by t he In ternal  Revenue Service \nnot to be  a private foundation with in the meaning of Section 509(a)  of the Internal \nRevenue Code .  \nGiveWell’s accounting policy provides that a tax expense or benefit from an uncertain \ntax position may be re cognized when it i s more l ikely than not that the position will be \nsustained upon examination. Management has determined that GiveWell has taken no \nuncertain tax position that  would require adjustment to the financial statements.  \nj. Advertising Costs  \nGiveWel l uses advertisin g specifically aimed  at encouraging potential donors to use its \nresearch, featured at its public website. The website provides prominent links for \ndonating to recommended charities . Accordingly, advertising costs have been allocated \nbetween fundraising and program.  Costs are expensed as incurred. For the year ended \nDecember 31, 2018 GiveWell incurred $268,906 of advertising expenses. For the year \nended December 31, 2018 GiveWell also received donated advertising expenses in the \namount of  $ 204,300 (see Note 6).  \nk. Comparative  Financial  Information \nThe financial statements include certain prior year  summarized comparative information \nin total, but not in sufficient detail to constitute a presentation in conformity with U.S. \nGAAP . Accordingly , such informat ion should be read in conjunction with GiveWell’s \nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, from which the summarized \ninformation was derived. \n\nThe Clear  Fund d.b.a. GiveWell \n \nNotes to  Financial Statements  \n \n \n \n10 l. Recent Accounting Pronouncements  \nAdopted \nIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting S tandards Board (FASB) issued Accounting \nStandar ds Update  (ASU)  2016- 14, Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958) Presen tation of \nFinancial Statements of Not -for-Profit, which changes presentation and disclosure \nrequirements for nonprofit entities to provide mor e relevant information about their \nresources (and the ch anges in those resources) to donors, granters, creditors, and other \nusers. These include qualitative and quantitative requirements in the following areas: net \nasset classes, investment return, expenses, and liquidity. Accordingly, the accounting \nchange has been retrospectively applied to all periods presented  with the exception of the \nomission of prior year functional expense and liquidity and availability of resourc e \ninformation as permitted by the AS U. \nAdoption Pending \nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018- 08, Not-for-Profit Entities  (Topic 958) : \nClarifying the Scope and the Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and \nContributions Made. The  amendments in this update are designed to assist ent ities in \nevaluating whether transactions should be  accounted f or as contributions, or as exchange \ntransactions, as well as determining whether a contribution is conditional. The \namendments in thi s ASU re lated to contributions received are effective for ann ual \nfinancial statements issued for fiscal years b eginning aft er December 15, 2018, while the \namendments related to  contributions made are effective one year later . Early adoption is \npermitted. Managemen t is currently evaluating the impact the amendments i n thi s ASU \nwill have on the financial statements.  \nm. Subsequent E vents  \nGiveWell evaluated subsequent events from December 31, 201 8 through July 5, 2019, \nthe date these financial statements were available to be is sued. There were no material \nsubsequent events that r equir ed recognition or additional disclosure in the se financial \nstatements.  \n \nNote 3 -   Grants Payable:  \nGrants payable at December 31, 2018 in the amount of $ 13,777,053 represents amounts that \nhave been committed to various grant ees, but not yet paid.

(GiveWell covers the full health insurance premiums for \nstaff, their partners and all dependents)  \n \nFoundations  \n \nNote that we did not update this data for 2019. A manual spot check of several of the charities \nfrom thie 2016 survey demonstrated that salaries have gone up but we did not feel there was a \ncompelling enough reason to investigate the remaini ng charities or use the updated data. \nBelow, we use the same data we showed last year: 2016 compensation data for foundations.  \n \nWe have private data from a 2016 survey of 131 foundations by Lasnik -­Broida Consultants, \nInc. in collaboration with The Croner Company.

We chose this tier because its median payout was the closest to \nGiveWell's money moved. GiveWell's estimate of total money directed to charities in \n2017 is $149,153,078.1 The next tier down in the compensation survey we relied on had \na median annual grants payout of $32 million.  \n \nResearch not -for-profits  \n \nIn July 2019, we pulled the most recent available staff compensation information from nine \nresear ch or charity -review -oriented not -for-profits: Innovations for Poverty Action, IDinsight, \nEvidence Action, Center for Global Development, Center for Effective Philanthropy, Urban \nInstitute, Guidestar, Charity Navigator, and Results for Development.  \n \nHere are the summary statistics for the salaries of the president, CEO, or Executive Director at \nthose organizations according to their 2017 or 2018 990s2: \n \nCompensation for Presidents and/or CEOs at 9 orgs from 2017 or 2018 990s  \n 25th percentile  50th percenti le 75th percentile  \nBase pay  $200,524  $238,499  $426,172  \nTotal compensation  $214,198  $269,159  $427,547  \n \nNotes:  \n● We have not adjusted for cost­ -of-­living.  \n● Details of this data are available in Exhibit A. \n \nAcademics   \nNote that we did not update this section for 2019.

Sections listed  in\n \ngrey are substantively unchanged from the November report.\n \n \n \n \nWhat is GiveWell's mission?\n \nWhat are our major areas of growth?\n \nWhat constitutes success?\n \nHow are we working to achieve these goals?\n \nWhat have we done recently to move towards these goals? How have we progressed? What\n \nare our plans?\n \nWhat else of note is happening at GiveWell?\n \nDocuments we have shared in the past\n \n \nWhat is GiveWell's mission?\n \n \nGiveWell's mission is to find outstanding giving opportunities and publish the full details of our\n \nanalysis to help donors decide where to give.\n \n \nWe accomplish our mission by finding the most cost-effective giving opportunities we can and\n \ndirecting as much money as possible to those recommendations (our money moved).\n \n \nNote: if we meaningfully expand our work on influence (the third bullet below), we'll probably\n \nwant to revise our mission statement.\n \n \nWhat are our major areas of growth?\n \n \nIn the next few years, we aim to increase our impact by:\n \n \n●\nFinding more cost-effective giving opportunities. \n​\nWe aim to evaluate opportunities\n \nthat go beyond the scope of the types of charities GiveWell has evaluated to date (more\n \nin \n​\nthis blog post\n​\n). This area is still new for us and the goal we have in mind is intended to\n \ncommunicate our direction; it's likely that we revise our goal as we learn more about this\n \narea. Currently, our goal is, by the end of 2022, direct at least $25 million per year to\n \nopportunities that we believe are significantly more cost-effective than the top charity we\n \nwould have otherwise directed funds to or conclude that the areas we're exploring are\n \nlikely less cost-effective than our top charities (or not sufficiently more cost-effective to\n \nbe worth the effort of exploring this new area).\n \n\n●\nIncreasing money moved. \n​\nOur goal is to reach $100 million money moved (excluding\n \nGood Ventures) by the end of giving season 2022 (i.e., January 31, 2023).\n \n●\nInfluencing institutional funders of global health and development.\n​\n We are\n \nexploring the possibility of influencing the giving of donor-governments, large\n \nfoundations, and multilateral institutions (e.g., the World Bank, Global Fund). This area is\n \nnew and we're uncertain about what constitute reasonable goals. We are currently\n \nthinking about goals like, within 5 years, direct at least $100 million to GiveWell's priority\n \nprograms or improve the cost-effectiveness of $500 million in institutional funding by at\n \nleast 2x.\n \nWhat constitutes success?\n \n \n●\nIf we achieve none of these goals, we would consider that a failure.\n \n●\nIf we achieve one of these goals, we consider that to be on expectations and a\n \nsignificant improvement in GiveWell's overall impact.\n \n●\nIf we achieve two or more of these goals, we would consider that to be an exceptional\n \nimprovement in GiveWell's overall impact.\n \nHow are we working to achieve these goals?\n \n \nMy (Elie's) top priorities are:\n \n \n●\nRecruiting researchers and managing/training newly hired senior researchers who\n \ncan contribute at a senior level, either as individual contributors or managers\n​\n. This\n \nis currently our biggest bottleneck to achieving our research goals. I also believe that\n \nmore senior researchers will meaningfully support our outreach goals by (a)\n \nconducting/leading outreach-oriented research projects, (b) improving our transparency,\n \nand (c) improving how we demonstrate / communicate about the quality of our work.\n \n●\nLeading our efforts to increase money moved. \n​\nI manage Jim Bobowski, our VP of\n \nMarketing and Stephanie Stojanovic, our Major Gifts Officer.\n \n \n○\nJim leads our efforts to acquire new donors via mass marketing and manages a\n \nteam of three.\n \n \n○\nSteph leads our efforts to retain and increase donations from people who've\n \ngiven before. She also works closely with me on opportunities to engage with\n \nnew, ultra-high-net-worth donors. She manages a team of three.\n \n●\nExploring institutional influence as a potential long-term priority for GiveWell.\n \nMichael Eddy leads this work. Buddy Shah starts in July and will lead this work and\n \nmanage Michael.\n \n\nWhat have we done recently to move towards these goals? How have we progressed?\n \nWhat are our plans?\n \n \n●\nRecruiting researchers.\n \n \n○\nIn late 2019:\n \n \n■\nTwo senior researchers started at GiveWell. One of them has begun\n \nmanaging a team of two.\n \n \n○\nGoing forward:\n \n■\nIn the next 2-3 years, I roughly hope to hire ~2 more\n \nmanager/director-level researchers and 3-5 more excellent individual\n \ncontributor researchers .\n \n■\nIn December 2019-February 2020, we participated in the American\n \nEconomic Association job market for students who expect to receive their\n \nPhDs in economics in 2020. We received many more, higher quality\n \napplications than in past years, but we've been disappointed by\n \napplicants' performance on our work trials. We still have a number of\n \ncandidates in the pipeline. My best guess is that we'll make 0-1 offers\n \nfrom this pool.\n \n■\nWe believe that having a background in evidence-based policy (i.e., using\n \nevidence to inform policy decisions) enabled one new staff member to\n \ncontribute very early at GiveWell. We're currently identifying and\n \ncontacting individuals who have similar career paths to discuss the\n \npossibility of their joining GiveWell.\n \n●\nIncreasing money moved.\n \n \n○\nIn 2019:\n \n \n■\nWe hired Jim Bobowski to lead our marketing efforts.\n \n \n■\nOur Head of Growth led projects to revamp our homepage and advertise\n \non podcasts. We suspect that the homepage revamp drove a significant\n \namount ($500k-$2 million) in donations, but we haven't yet analyzed the\n \ndata to be confident. We spent $150,000 on podcasts ads (which we\n \nsupported with matching funds) and they drove more than $500,000 in\n \nnew donations.\n \n■\nMajor Gifts raised more than $1 million in counterfactual donations. We\n \nalso believe their work on a direct mail and email campaign led to\n \napproximately another ~$1 million in donations but we haven't yet\n \nanalyzed this to be confident.\n \n○\nIn 2020:\n \n■\nMarketing aims to increase our podcast advertising spend from $150,000\n \nto $500,000, assuming we can identify high-quality advertising\n \nopportunities and find matching funds. We also aims to spend $500,000\n \n\non paid advertising in other places aiming for a first-year tracked return on\n \ninvestment of 1.5.\n \n1\n■\nMajor gifts aims to increase total giving among existing major donors by\n \n$5-7 million.\n \n \n●\nExploring institutional Influence.\n \n○\nThis is still very early stage and a work in progress. I'm happy to talk through this\n \nin greater detail if there's interest, but don't think there's any specific part of this\n \nthat's worth discussing in detail at this point.\n \n \n○\nWe have set tentative goals for 2020, but we think these are reasonably likely to\n \nchange as we (along with incoming new staff refine our thinking about the\n \napproach we should take in this domain.\n \nWhat else of note is happening at GiveWell?\n \nOverall, GiveWell's nearly 40-person team is more capable than it has ever been. We're making\n \nprogress in every single area.\n \n \n●\nOperations added two Operations Associates in 2019 who are enabling Operations to\n \ntake on more than it has in the past.\n \n●\nThetop charities team is running smoothly, with nearly no involvement from the CEO.\n \n●\nIndividual researchers are working to find new giving opportunities.\n \n \nDocuments we have shared in the past\n \n●\nDocument from the November 2019 board meeting [link redacted]\n \n \n●\nDocument from the July 2019 board meeting [link redacted]\n \n○\nUpdate to that document shared before the meeting [link redacted]\n \n●\n2017 strategy review [link redacted]\n \n●\n2018 strategy review [link redacted]\n \n1\n Historically, we've retained approximately 100% of dollars donated over time. This means that if we\n \nreceive $1 in year one, our best guess is that we'll continue to receive $1 into the future. Therefore, we\n \nsee a 1.5 return on a dollar invested in year 1 as a good return on investment.\n "

As an organization, GiveWell comprises several domains of various sizes: research,\n \noutreach, operations, engagement, and management.\n Each domain has its own \n​\ndomain goal\n​\n:\n \n1\n●\nResearch: Identify the most cost-effective opportunities to support and make a public\n \ncase for them.\n \n●\nOutreach: Maximize the philanthropic dollars influenced by GiveWell's\n \nrecommendations.\n \n●\nOperations: Optimize GiveWell's development and use of human, financial and material\n \nresources to achieve its goals.\n \n●\nEngagement: Optimize the impact of institutional funders.\n \n●\nManagement: Establish and direct GiveWell's strategy to achieve its overarching goal.\n \n \nEach domain can then be defined as having 2 or 3 \n​\nsubgoals\n​\n, outlined in the 'domain subgoals'\n \ntab of \n​\nthis document\n​\n. Just as the domain goals support GiveWell's overarching goal, the\n \nsubgoals support each domain goal.\n \n \nWithin each subgoal, we set \n​\nobjectives\n​\n for the year and for the first quarter (where applicable).\n \nThese objectives should be defined so that they enable us to easily assess success or failure\n \n(e.g., an objective like 'increase X' should specify the amount by which X needs to increase to\n \nbe considered a success). Each quarter, we will set objectives for the upcoming quarter, except\n \nin the domains for which we've already broken out objectives by quarter, in which case we'll\n \njust reassess progress on a quarterly basis. We will track progress in the 'dashboard' tab of \n​\nthis\n \ndocument\n​\n.\n \n \nThis scorecard and dashboard is a first pass at more clearly articulating the links between our\n \ngoal as an organization and each of the projects we're pursuing in the interest of that goal.\n \nIdeally, each goal and subgoal would be as specific as possible while remaining broad enough\n \nto fully capture that piece of work.\n \nWhy this work matters\n \nThe reasons for creating these plans and sharing them are twofold:\n \n1\n It's possible that the way we've defined 'engagement' and 'management' as distinct domains will\n \nevolve in the near-term, as these areas are nascent. 'Management' as used here is distinct from\n \npersonnel management.\n \n\n1.\nTo progress towards our overarching goal of improving the lives of people living in\n \nglobal poverty via improved planning. By thoughtfully and systematically setting\n \nobjectives for the years and considering how those objectives feed into our higher-level\n \ngoals, we may be able to make better decisions about which projects to prioritize,\n \nultimately increasing the impact of our work.\n \n2.\nTo improve staff morale and sense of engagement with GiveWell's work and mission,\n \nand increase understanding of the role each staff member plays in achieving our goals.\n \n \nDashboard\n \nThe \n​\nDashboard\n​\n provides the most coherent glimpse of GiveWell’s high level goals and plans.\n \nThis is structured in a waterfall fashion, each tab flowing out of the preceding tab, as follows:\n \n \n●\nTab 1 - Instructions\n \n●\nTab 2 - Organizational and domain (i.e. department) level goals\n \n●\nTab 3 - Domain level sub goals\n \n \n●\nTab 4 - 2020 key projects by domain\n \n●\nTab 5 - Detailed work plans (This tab is provided strictly for reference for those who\n \nmay wish to delve into certain plans in detail)\n "

          "text": "GiveWell 2020 marketing plan overview Summary  Marketing is new for GiveWell. We hired our first marketing lead in November 2019.  This year, we're focused on four main areas: ● Paid advertising ● Donor research ● Site improvements ● Performance measurement  Overall, we expect this work to move $1.5 million additional in 2020.  We don't plan to add many full-time staff to the marketing team this year. We plan to rely on vendors to provide additional capacity. Paid advertising Our goal is to build a paid marketing operation that directs significantly more money to GiveWell and our recommendations than we spend.   This year, we're moving towards this by (a) continuing to assess how much we can successfully invest in podcasts, the channel that has worked in the past and (b) get early indications of our potential ability to move money via new channels.  ● Advertising where we expect a high return. We successfully advertised on podcasts in 2019. We spent $180K and tracked ~$571K from new donors in 2019. We plan to spend $540k in giving season 2020 and aim to return $890k in first-year donations.1 ● Experimental advertising. We plan to test (a) podcast advertising outside of giving season and (b) other advertising channels (e.g., Facebook, search, retargeting2, YouTube) to see if they yield reasonable returns. We currently expect to spend $400k and return $200k in first-year donations. The results of these experiments will dictate which channels we spend more on in the future.   1 Based on past experience, we roughly estimate that approximately 90% of dollars given in year 1 recur in future years. For example, if donors give $100 in year 1, we roughly estimate that they will continue to give $90 in each subsequent year. 2 This article explains what retargeting is: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/retargeting-campaigns-beginner-guide. \n\nResearch We are conducting research with existing donors and non-donors to better understand how they view GiveWell, our website, and how they make their charitable giving decisions. This research will help shape our messaging, lead to site improvements, and help with our long-term strategic positioning. We have linked the documents below. So far, this research has not surprised us but has helped us prioritize changes.   Completed Research ● Customer satisfaction survey [Redacted] ● Donor deeper research [Redacted] ● User experience (i.e., visiting the website for the first time) research  Future Research Projects ● Non-donors - June ● Positioning - July ● Additional UX - July Site improvements Using the above, we plan to make improvements to the GiveWell website to increase visitors' ability to understand what we do, why they should trust our research/process, and lead more potential donors to make donations to GiveWell. We aim to make improvements that increase the amount of money we receive by $250,000 in 2020. Performance measurement We have a reasonable, though suboptimal, ability to measure the performance of our marketing work. We don't have high-quality estimates for what it costs us to acquire a new donor via paid marketing, nor do we have high-quality estimates of the amount a donor is likely to give over time. Knowing these values will provide a way to determine the right amount of money to spend on marketing to maximize donations. A note on team building Our marketing team currently consists of a VP of Marketing, a Head of Growth, a Marketing Associate and a Technical Project Manager. We plan to mostly use vendors and consultants to meet our needs until we're confident we should hire full-time staff.   We may hire some additional staff in 2020, but we are most likely to hire new staff once we determine which channels we are most likely to invest in in 2021 and beyond. "

The   goal   was   to   \nidentify   the   challenges   that   new   visitors   have   on   GiveWell’s   website.   From   this,   we’ll   work   with   \nour   researcher   and   designer,   Erik   Kennedy,   to   redesign   problematic   pages   on   the   site   to   \nimprove   conversions.     \n  \nWe   found   interview   subjects   by   asking   donors   to   introduce   us   to   their   friends   who   they   think   \nmight   be   interested   in   GiveWell,   but   are   unfamiliar   with   GiveWell   (have   not   donated,   have   not   \nvisited   the   site).   We   screened   donors   to   check   that:   \n●They   were   not   overly   familiar   with   GiveWell   or   Effective   Altruism  \n●They   had   donated   over   $300   in   the   past   year   \n  \nErik   conducted   interviews   via   Zoom.   We   worked   with   Erik   to   design   a   script   for   him   to   walk   \ndonors   through.   After   a   set   of   preliminary   questions,   he   assigned   them   tasks   on   the   website.   \nThey   narrated   their   thoughts   as   they   used   the   site,   and   Erik   would   ask   clarifying   questions   \nduring   the   interview   so   we   best   understood   how   users   approached   problems.   \n  \nErik   has   completed   the   first   round   of   research,   which   consisted   of   six   interviews.

The   main   argument   in   favor   of   building   out   donor   retention   programs   at   lower   levels   of   \ngiving   is   that   the   donor   pyramid   works   as   a   pipeline–it   often   takes   3-4   years   of   giving   at   lower   \nlevels   and   building   a   relationship   with   GiveWell   before   a   donor   makes   their   first   major   gift.   We   \ncannot   risk   losing   too   many   lower-level   donors   due   to   poor   retention   rates.     \n2020   donor   retention   structure   \n  \n  \nSTAFF DONORS APPROACH   \nGive   ~$50k+ 1:1   relationships   \n~350   donors     \n~70%   of   dollars   \n  \n  \nGive   ~$10-50k Modest   1:1   relationship     \n~1,000   donors   \n~20%   of   dollars   \n  \n  \nGive   ~$10k   and   less 1:Many   relationship     \n~44,000*   donors     \n~10%   of   dollars   \n  \n\n\n  \n*You   may   be   thinking:   I   thought   we   had   over   50,000   donors!   Why   are   there   fewer   donors   in   the   retention   \nprogram?   Answer:   we   can   only   include   ‘contactable’   donors   in   our   retention   program   as   we   have   to   be   able   \nto   contact   a   donor   to   be   able   to   influence   their   giving.   As   such,   we   have   removed   all   anonymous   donors   \nand   donors   without   emails   or   addresses   from   our   denominator   (as   well   as   those   who   have   actively   opted   \nout   of   hearing   from   us).   We   are   also   mainly   focused   on   donors   who   give   via   GiveWell   (not   direct   to   charity)   \nin   this   first   year   of   the   program.   Direct   to   charity   donors   may   become   a   larger   focus   in   later   years.     \n  \nBroad   2020   goals   \n1.Increase   engagement   opportunities   for   current   donors   and   build   greater   loyalty/affinity   with   \nGiveWell.     \n2.Increase   incremental   money   moved   from   current   donors:   \n○Major:   $3,000,000   \n○Mid:   $500,000   \n○Mass:   $500,000   \n  \nPlans/activities   to   achieve   2020   goals   \nEach   domain   \n    Better   engagement   Incremental   dollars   \nMajor   Ensure   gift   officers   work   their   \nengagement   plans .   Gift   officers   have   a   12   \nmonth   engagement   plan   for   each   donor   in   \ntheir   portfolio.   Through   monthly   reporting   on   \ngift   officer   activity,   we   will   ensure   that   each   \nplan   is   being   executed   and   donors   are   \nbeing   actively   engaged   with   each   month.     \n  \nLaunch   GiveWell   Council .   We   plan   to   \nlaunch   GiveWell   Council   (name   TBC)   so   \nthat   major   donors   have   a   volunteer   \nopportunity.   The   charter   for   the   council   is   to   \nhelp   GiveWell   attract   and   grow   its   \nsupporter-base,   so   they   will   explicitly   be   \ncharged   with   helping   outreach   initiatives.     Create   specific   giving   opportunities .   We   \nwill   be   pitching   top   charity   gaps   (for   example,   \ncountry   gaps),   incubation   grants,   and   seeking   \nfunding   for   special   projects   like   matching   \ncampaigns   for   marketing   channel   and  \nmessaging   testing.We   will   explicitly   highlight   \nfungibility   with   donors.     \n  \nPlan   and   make   enough   incremental   asks.   \nOur   assumption   is   that   we   will   ‘close’   about   \n50%   of   asks   and   about   25%   of   total   dollars   \n(some   donors   agree   to   the   ask,   but   end   up   \nmaking   a   smaller   gift   than   asked).   We   \ncurrently   have   ~$15m   in   asks   planned   for   \n2020.   Plans   will   shift   throughout   the   year.     \nMid   Monthly   personal   engagement.    Send   \nmonthly   emails   with   information   about   \nGiveWell’s   research   and   top   charities.     \n  Personally   solicit   all   donors   at   year-end.   \nSend   solicitations   at   year   end.     \n\n  \nPipeline   development   \nPipeline/pyramid   development   is   an   important   priority   across   all   domains.   In   2020   we   plan   to:   \n  \n1.Fast   track   donors   up   the   pipeline.    As   a   result   of   deeper   engagement,   we   hope   to   learn   \nmore   about   our   donors   and   identify   top   candidates   to   ‘fast   track’   up   the   pipeline.   We   plan   \nto:   \na.Research    new   donors   via   publicly   available   information   and   identify   those   with   \nhigher   giving   capacity.   \nb.Validate    donors   through   calls/meetings   to   move   donors   with   high   capacity   and   \nhigh   affinity   into   mid-level   and   major   gift   portfolios.     \n  \n2.Identify   new   major   donor   prospects .   As   we   have   limited   capacity   for   prospecting   work,   \nwe   plan   to   use   the   following   strategies   opportunistically   as   they   arise   in   2020:     \na.Referrals    are   a   strong   source   of   new   high-capacity   prospects.   We   plan   to   work   \nwith   the   GiveWell   Council   and   donors   in   major   gift   portfolios   to   seek   personal   \nreferrals   of   friends,   family   and   corporate   connections.   \nb.Partner   with   select   institutions .   While   we   don’t   have   the   capacity   to   roll   out   an   \ninstitutional   giving   program,   there   are   a   handful   of   aligned   companies,   wealth   \nadvisors   and   peer   organizations   like   Founders   Pledge   and   Effective   Giving   that   \nreach   out   to   us   and   are   good   sourcing   partners   for   GiveWell.   We   will   ensure   that   \nthere   is   capacity   to   develop   these   relationships.   \n  \nDetailed   metrics   and   progress   \nAvailable   here   [REDACTED].     \n  Year-end   personal   engagement.    Offer   \nyear-end   calls   to   discuss   GiveWell’s   \nrecommendations   and   answer   questions.     \nMass   Personalize   engagement.    Segment   donors   \nbased   on   past   behavior.   Move   to   donor-   and   \nbenefit-focused   communications.   \n  \nSend   year-round   communications.    Plan   a   \nconsistent   flow   of   communication   that   starts   \nout   thanking   donors,   moves   on   to   cultivating   \nthem   with   impact   stories,   and   finally   solicits   \nthem   with   a   compelling   ask.     Test   messaging   and   calls   to   action.    Tests   \ninclude   recurring   gift   messaging,   matching   \ngifts,   funding   gaps,   etc.     \n  \n  \nSolicit   donors   throughout   the   year.    Create   \nurgency   outside   of   year-end   to   seek   multiple   \ngifts   or   shift   donors   to   give   ahead   of   cycle.   \nTests   include   integrating   with   marketing   \ncampaigns,   using   external   events   (e.g.   World   \nMalaria   Day),   quarterly   allocations,   etc.   "

          "text": "  \nCOVID-19   Effects   on   GiveWell   \nSummary   \n  \nThis   is   a   short   document   covering   the   major   ways   in   which   COVID-19   has   affected   GiveWell   \nand   our   2020   plans.   \n  \nCOVID-19   has   had   major   effects   on   where   we   work   (all   remotely)   and   has   modestly   reduced   the   \namount   of   time   many   staff   (especially   parents)   can   work,   but   we   don't   expect   it   to   have   major   \neffects   on   GiveWell's   plans   for   2020   or   the   future.   \nOperating   Funding   \n  \nGiveWell   has   a   substantial   amount   of   operating   reserves,   and   we   expect   that   the   operating   \nfunding   we   receive   in   2020   will   cover   our   growing   expenses.   Given   our   fundraising   expectations   \nand   reserves,   we   plan   to   operate   in   2020   as   we   planned   to   before   COVID-19.   \n  \nAttachment   E   provides   more   detail.   In   short,   we   currently   project   raising   $13.4   million   in   2020   \nand   spending   $11.2   million.   In   a   severely   negative   scenario,   we   anticipate   raising   $8.5   million.   \nWe   currently   hold   $17   million   in   reserves.   \nResearch   \n●COVID-specific   research.    Two   staff   members   are   now   working   full-time   on   \nCOVID-19-related   research   and   grantmaking.   We   expect   this   to   continue   for   at   least   \nanother   6   weeks   but   it   may   end   after   that.   As   of   May   12th,   we   have   made   three   grants   to   \nCOVID-19-specific   projects .     \n●Top   charities.    We   expect   that   our   top   charities   will   have   less   room   for   more   funding   in   \n2020   than   they   otherwise   would   have   because   COVID   has   slowed   their   ability   to   run   \nprograms.     \n●New   opportunities.    COVID   has   slowed   our   work   looking   for   new   top   charities   and   new   \ngiving   opportunities   in   public   health   regulation   because   organizations'   work   has   been   \ndisrupted.   We're   in   close   contact   with   the   most   promising   organizations   so   that   we   can   \nresume   our   research   when   possible.   There   are   some   organizations   (e.g.,   New   \nIncentives,   where   we   recently   received   results   from   an   RCT   we   funded   of   its   work)   \nwhere   our   evaluation   can   go   ahead   notwithstanding   COVID.   \nOutreach     \nMajor   Gifts   and   the   donor   retention   team   are   in   the   process   of   contacting   our   major   donors   to   \nunderstand   the   extent   to   which   COVID   will   affect   their   giving   plans   in   2020.   Overall,   the   donors   \nthey   have   talked   to   have   said   that   COVID   will   not   have   a   major   effect   on   their   giving.     \n\n  \nOur   marketing   work   is   new,   and   we   have   relatively   little   basis   on   which   to   make   projections.   \nBased   on   the   data   the   retention   team   has   gathered   and   the   fact   that   GiveWell   donors   are   \ncontinuing   to   give,   we   currently   expect   that   marketing   will   move   approximately   as   much   money   \nas   we   expected   pre-COVID.   We   continue   to   follow   this   data   closely   so   that   we   quickly   update   \nour   forecasts   if   the   situation   changes.   \nOperations   \nAll   GiveWell   staff   now   work   remotely.   We   continue   to   pay   for   our   office   space   and   don't   currently   \nbelieve   we   can   reduce   that   expense.   We   don't   currently   expect   to   be   back   in   our   office   for   a   \nwhile.   \n  \nWe   run   a   weekly   survey   of   all   staff   to   ask   how   they   are   feeling   and   how   they   feel   their   work   is   \ngoing.   We   have   used   this   to   follow   up   with   staff   who   seem   to   be   struggling.   Overall,   people   \nseem   to   be   doing   OK   and   improving,   though   several   staff   are   struggling.   We   created   a   monthly   \nstaff   wellness   stipend   (redirected   from   our   office   snacks   budget)   that   staff   can   use   on   expenses   \nthat   improve   their   physical,   mental,   or   emotional   wellbeing   during   shelter-in-place.   \n  \nWe   are   tracking   regulatory   updates   that   pertain   to   employers   and   have   implemented   and   \nnotified   staff   about   the   relevant   updates   to   paid   time   off,   insurance   coverage,   and   retirement   \nplans.

What are our \nfuture plans?\nHow has COVID-19 affected our progress? How might\nit in the future?\nDocuments we have shared in the past\nWhat is GiveWell's mission?\nGiveWell's mission is to find outstanding giving opportunities\nand publish the full details of our\nanalysis to help donors decide where to give.\nWe accomplish our mission by finding the most cost-effective\ngiving opportunities we can and\ndirecting as much money as possible to those recommendations\n(our money moved).\nNote: if we meaningfully expand our work on influence\n(the third bullet below), we'll probably\nwant to revise our mission statement.\nWhat are our major areas of growth?\nIn the next few years, we aim to increase our impact\nby:\n●\nFinding more cost-effective giving opportunities.\nWe aim to significantly increase the\namount of highly cost-effective room for more funding\nthat we can recommend to donors.\n1\n\nUnless we find additional room for more funding, we believe that our future money\nmoved will surpass the room for more funding we identify.\n○\nIncreased scale at similar levels of cost-effectiveness:\nWe plan to continue to\nevaluate opportunities that are similar to our top\ncharities in terms of their\ncost-effectiveness and broad approach. Over the past\nyear, we have increased\nour research staff capacity and capabilities, which\nwill enable us to evaluate more\nopportunities than in the past.\n○\nBroader scope at greater levels of cost-effectiveness:\nWe aim to evaluate\nopportunities that go beyond the scope of the types\nof charities GiveWell has\nevaluated to date (more in\nthis blog post\n). This area\nis still new for us, and the\ngoal we have in mind is intended to communicate our\ndirection; it's likely that we\nwill revise our goal as we learn more about this area.\nCurrently, our goal is that\nby the end of 2022, either (a) direct at least $25\nmillion per year to opportunities\nthat we believe are significantly more cost-effective\nthan the top charity we would\nhave otherwise directed funds to or (b) conclude that\nthe areas we're exploring\nare likely less cost-effective than our top charities\n(or not sufficiently more\ncost-effective to be worth the effort of exploring\nthis new area).\n●\nIncreasing money moved.\nOur goal is to reach $100\nmillion money moved (excluding\nOpen Philanthropy) by the end of giving season 2022\n(i.e., January 31, 2023).\n1\n●\nInfluencing institutional funders of global health\nand development.\nWe are\nexploring the possibility of influencing the giving\nof donor-governments, large\nfoundations, and multilateral institutions (e.g.,\nthe World Bank, Global Fund). This area is\nnew, and we're uncertain about what constitutes reasonable\ngoals. We are currently\nthinking about goals like: within five years,\ndirect\nat least $100 million to GiveWell's\n2\npriority programs or improve the cost-effectiveness\nof $500 million in institutional funding\nby at least 2x.\nWhat constitutes success?\n●\nIf we achieve none of the three above goals, we would\nconsider that a failure.\n●\nIf we achieve one of these goals, we consider that\nto be in line with expectations and a\nsignificant improvement in GiveWell's overall impact.\n●\nIf we achieve two or more of these goals, we would\nconsider that to be an exceptional\nimprovement in GiveWell's overall impact.\nHow are we working to achieve these goals?\n2\nWe're working toward this goal on a longer time frame\nbecause it's newer and we expect it will take \nlonger to make meaningful progress.\n1\nWe exclude Open Philanthropy giving from our money\nmoved goals because we expect Open Phil to \nmake an independent decision about how much to give\nto global health and development.\n2\n\nMy (Elie's) top priorities are:\n●\nRecruiting researchers and managing/training newly\nhired senior researchers who\ncan contribute at a senior level, either as individual\ncontributors or managers\n.\nResearch capacity and capability are currently our biggest bottlenecks to achieving our\nresearch goals. Senior researchers will also likely\nsupport our outreach goals by (a)\nconducting/leading outreach-oriented research projects,\n(b) improving our transparency\nby publishing more of the research work we do, and\n(c) improving how we demonstrate\nthat out research is high quality, i.e., that our\nresearch is arriving at the best conclusions\nwe can reach.\n●\nLeading our efforts to increase money moved.\nI manage\nthe Director of Marketing\nand the Director of Development.\n○\nThe Director of Marketing leads our efforts to acquire\nnew donors via mass\nmarketing and manages a team of three.\n○\nThe Director of Development leads our efforts to retain\nand increase donations\nfrom people who've given before. She also works closely\nwith me on\nopportunities to engage with new major donors. She\nmanages a team of three.\n●\nExploring institutional influence as a potential long-term\npriority for GiveWell.\nOur\nManaging Director started in July and will lead this\nwork, and I manage him.\nWhat have we done over the past year to make progress\ntowards these goals? What are\nour future plans?\n●\nRecruiting researchers.\n○\nWe hired two senior researchers\n.\nThey started last\nfall. This year, we have hired\ntwo additional senior researchers.\n○\nWe have also hired three entry-level researchers.\n●\nIncreasing money moved.\n○\nIn 2019:\n■\nWe hired a Director of Marketing to lead our marketing\nefforts.\n■\nWe raised more than $1 million in counterfactual donations\nthrough our\nmajor gifts program. We also believe a direct mail\nand email campaign led\nto approximately another ~$1 million in donations;\nwe haven't yet\nanalyzed this to be confident.\n○\nIn 2020:\n■\nWe aim to increase our podcast advertising spend from\n$150,000 to\n$500,000, assuming we can identify high-quality advertising\nopportunities\nand find matching funds. We also aim to spend $500,000\non paid\n3\n\nadvertising in other places, aiming for a first-year tracked return on\ninvestment of 1.5.\n3\n■\nThe major gifts team aims to increase total giving\namong existing major\ndonors by $3 million.\n■\nWe have built a donor retention program that didn't previously exist,\nparticularly moving to engage non-major donors more\ndirectly. We will\ncontinue to build this out.\n●\nExploring institutional Influence.\nThis is still very\nearly stage and a work in progress.\nOur Managing Director started in July, and he will\ntake the lead on developing a strategy\ngoing forward.\nHow has COVID-19 affected our progress? How might\nit in the future?\n●\nOperating funding:\nWe have not yet seen material negative\neffects on our operating\nfunding. We are in a stable financial position. We\nreassess our financial position every\nsix weeks to ensure we've considered the most up-to-date\ninformation.\n●\nResearch:\n○\nWe have recommended grants totaling approximately\n$3 million to\nCOVID-specific opportunities. We wrote about the first\nof these grants in this\nblog\npost\n. We haven't yet published information on the\nremaining grants (~$700,000\nto IDinsight and ~$2 million to IPA [Innovations for\nPoverty Action] for an RCT of\ncommunity mask use).\n○\nWe detail the effects COVID has had on some of our\ntop charities in\nthis blog\npost\n.\n●\nOffice:\nWe don't expect most staff to return to the\noffice on a regular basis in the near\nfuture. Roughly half of GiveWell's staff lives outside\nthe Bay Area (reducing the benefit of\nreturning to the office). We surveyed staff, and at\nthe moment there is very limited\ninterest among Bay Area-based staff in returning to\nthe office (when permitted by local\nhealth authorities). If we were to reopen in the future,\nwe would follow recommended\npractices including mask use and physical distancing,\namong others.\nDocuments we have shared in the past\n[Note: documents from prior Board meetings may be\naccessed from their respective Board\nmeeting pages, linked\nhere\n.

However, we may indicate specific places whereredactions were made if they improve thereadability of the document (for example, clarifyingthat a link has been made confidential, or explainingthe jump from one topic to another) or may make minorclarifying edits.\nGiveW ell Foreign Registration\nExecutive Summary\nBackground\nAt the request of the Outreach team, the Operations\nteam has been looking into registration in\nforeign countries.\nThe primary expected benefits of this are to:\n●\nfacilitate easier, tax-deductible donations for our\nforeign donors (including bequests,\nwhich are currently very difficult);\n●\nimprove growth opportunities and prospects for long-term\ncultivation of major donors.\nGiveWell looked into five countries where we had existing\ndonors and/or a known opportunity\n(Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, the\nUK). We propose to move forward with\nregistration in two: the Netherlands and the UK.\nThis limited determination is largely based on two\nfactors:\n●\nA strong preference for easing into maintaining a\nforeign presence rather than plunging\nheadfirst. This allows us to test our ability to accommodate\nadditional reporting,\nbookkeeping, and management requirements.\n●\nThe UK and the Netherlands are clearly easier projects\nthan the other three countries:\nthe up-front and ongoing administrative burden and\nrequirements to register and remain\ncompliant are less demanding and more straight-forward\nin the UK and the Netherlands.\nAdditional proposal information [confidential] and\nsummary country comparison info\n[confidential] are provided here.\nAdditional legal considerations\nRegistering in foreign countries does constitute the\ncreation of separate legal entities. While we\nfeel the potential rewards greatly outweigh the potential\nrisks, this introduces the responsibility\nthat GiveWell has to comply with foreign regulatory\nrequirements.\nMost notably:\n\n●\nEach entity will constitute a separate legal body, registered locally as the local equivalent\nof a public charity, not a subsidiary of GiveWell US\n[Note added 3/2/21: after the Board\nmeeting, we learned that the Netherlands entity would\nnot be a separate legal entity.]\n●\nEach entity will need to submit annual financial filings.\n○\nIn the case of the Netherlands, the existing reporting\nalready published on\nGiveWell’s website is understood to suffice.\n○\nIn the UK, we expect to have to produce a separate\nreport and/or supplement our\nexisting report to submit to UK officials, particularly\nafter annual revenue exceeds\n£1m.\n■\nGiveWell expects the additional donations will be\nworth the costs for\nadditional bookkeeping.\n●\nEach entity will need to have trustees.\n○\nIn the case of the Netherlands, the GiveWell US board\nof directors can serve. In\nthat case, the board members would be subject to any\nfiduciary obligations under\nNetherlands law with respect to the Netherlands organization\nseparately and in\naddition to the duties that apply to them under US\nlaw with respect to the US\nentity. We are not currently aware of obligations\nbeyond the existing reporting\nnoted above.\n○\nIn the UK, a minimum of three trustees are needed,\nat least two of whom need to\nbe independent and one of whom, preferably, is resident\nin the UK. As we\nunderstand it, the purpose of having independent trustees\nis to ensure the entity\nis not controlled by another entity. This means in\nparticular that GW-affiliated\npeople cannot serve in a majority of roles. However,\nGiveWell’s CEO can serve\nas a “super trustee” with superior authority (i.e.,\nto appoint and dismiss other\ntrustees), but a quorum of the trustees are required\nto grant out the UK funds.\n■\nWe believe we can identify two additional persons\nwho would be eager to\nserve in these roles and who are aligned with the\nintent of GiveWell UK\ncontributing to and magnifying GiveWell US’s existing\nmission and\napproach.\n○\nGiveWell UK can outsource all operations to GiveWell\nUS, which we would do;\nthus, we expect GiveWell UK trustees to inquire and\naccept recommendations\nfrom GiveWell US as to the best disposition of funds,\nbut the UK entity must\nretain formal independence.\n■\nIn effect, UK funds would thus remain in the UK until\nthe GiveWell UK\ntrustees approve a recommendation made by GiveWell\nUS.\n●\nWe will want to add or increase our D&O insurance\ncoverage.\n○\nIn the case of the Netherlands, we believe we can\nadd to our existing policy.\nSince the starting revenue point is quite low, we\ndon’t expect this to add much to\nthe premium at first.\n○\nIn the UK, we will likely need to open a separate\npolicy.\n○\nWe cannot get a direct quote until these entities\nare more defined and we can\nanswer questions from the insurers more definitively.\n\nWe request that the Board approve expansion to foreign jurisdictions as determined by\nmanagement."

Approval of budget : \nVote on revised 2020 budget and 2021 budgets. Note that we will propose an update to the 2021 budget in early to mid 2021. \na. 2020 Update: We are not requesting approval of any additional budget in 2020. We expect 2020 expenses to be $10.0m, \n$1.2m below the $11.2m approved in mid 2019. \nb. Forward projections: The 2020 budget represents a $4.4m increase over 2019 actuals. For 2021 we are requesting \n$13.9m, which represents a $3.9m increase over the 2020 budget. These increases are primarily driven by new research \nand outreach staff, outreach discretionary spend on marketing, and modest operations increases. \n1. Application of single revenue cap : \nWe apply an operating principle to limit the revenue from any single source to avoid over-reliance on any particular donor. To \naction this rule we propose to irrevocably designate a portion of one donation as restricted for grants at GiveWell’s discretion. \n\n\nLooking Back: 2019 Summary \n\nLooking back: 2019 summary \n●We had strong revenue growth across our broad \nbase of donors \n●We spent less than we budgeted in 2019  (-25%) \n●Individual donor gave $7.5m ($3.9m of that was \nrestricted in mid 2019) \n●Open Philanthropy Project Fund grant of $2.5m \nincluded in 2019 revenue (although grant received \nin Jan 2020) \n\n\nUnrestricted Revenue projections vs. actuals for 2019 \nContinued broad-based revenue growth \nCommentary: \n● Open Philanthropy Project \nFund grant: $2.5m \n● Individual donor grant: \n$7.5m ($3.9 later restricted) \n12% of total 34% of total 41% of total \n13% of total \n\nExpense projections vs. actuals for 2019 \nWe spent $1.5m less than budgeted in 2019 \nwith underruns in: \n● Staff: $0.3m below budget \n● Advertising/Outreach: $0.8m below budget \n● Misc admin: $0.4m below budget \n\n\nLooking forward: \nRevenue projections and \nspending proposal \n\nChanges to 2020 budget since mid-2019 \nNotes: \n●Budget net decrease of \n$1.2m. \n●Decrease in staff (-$1.6m) \nand admin ($87k) \n●Increase in advertising & \noutreach costs (+$438k) \n\n\nProposed budget for 2020-2022 \nFocus of spending is new staff for research and outreach, \noutreach marketing spend, and modest increases for \noperations \n\n\nLooking forward: revenue projections and \noperational spending proposal \n●Our proposed expenses increase from $5.6m in 2019 to $17.8m in 2022. \n● Greatest spending increases are for new staff in the Research and Outreach departments. \n● We have already begun and plan to continue soliciting funding from major donors to support our growing \noperational funding needs. \n● COVID-19 has not had a material impact on donation levels to date, but we would reconsider our spending \nplans if this changed. \n●Based on current asset levels and conservative revenue projections, we recommend \ngranting out ~$1.7m in unrestricted funds per the single revenue cap. \n● Using our most conservative COVID-19 projections, we estimate that we could fall below the threshold of 12 \nmonths of assets as of July 2021. Hence no action is needed to satisfy the excess assets policy. \n● One individual gave an unrestricted donation that exceeds 20% of our proposed 2021 & 2022 operating \nbudgets. To action the rule of limiting our operations revenue from a single revenue source, we propose to \nirrevocably restrict a portion of this donation to grants at GiveWell’s discretion. \n● Given the current economic uncertainty, we propose to retain the remainder of this donation (~$6.3m) for 20% \nof our expected budget in 2021 & 2022. \n\nBudget approach – 2020-2022 \n●We request approval for significant spending increases for staff and outside services \nacross all the organization (operations, outreach, and research) to increase our impact \n○YOY, staffing costs increase 61% by year-end 2020; 60% in 2021; 31% in 2022. \n○Outreach expenses (advertising, PR, consultants, software, etc.) increase by $1.8m in 2020 \n(652%) followed by modest increase of $0.3m in 2021 (14%) and $0.6m in 2022 (23%). \n●Our request for staff expenses is based on budgeting for compensation and benefits \nwith annual increases plus projected hires; other expense categories are budgeted \nbased on experience and anticipated changes. \n●We request a safety net equivalent to 10% of non-staff total for unexpected expenses. \n\nSingle-donor revenue cap (additional details) \n● GiveWell has adopted an informal rule (the “single revenue cap”) that no one revenue source should provide more \nthan 20% of our operating funding each year. This forces us to maintain a broad base of donors, which increases the \nstability of our donor base and reduces the possibility of our research agenda being captured by a single donor. \n● Historically, we have applied this policy to Good Ventures and one individual donor whose donations might otherwise \nexceed 20% of our annual operating expenses. \n● The individual told us that it is likely they will give at least 20% of our operating expenses in each of the next 3 years, \nbut due to projected growth in expenses, there is a non-negligible chance they will not. \n● To increase the safety of our financial position, we propose retaining two years worth of funding from this donor \n(instead of one year). This will give us more time to adjust and raise more funding if the donor doesn’t give at least \n20% of our operating expenses in a future year. \n● In 2019, one individual gave an unrestricted donation that exceeded 20% of our combined 2019 and 2020 operating \nbudget. The board approved retaining 20% of the 2019 budget and 20% of the 2020 budget as unrestricted and \nrestricted the remainder, ~$3.9 million, to regranting at GiveWell’s discretion. \n● That same donor gave an amount in 2020 that again exceeded 20% of our combined 2021 and 2022 operating \nbudgets. We propose retaining 20% of the 2021 and 20% of the 2022 budget, $6.3 million, as unrestricted funding \nand restricting the remainder (~$1.7m) as part of the single donor cap. \n\nPotential staffing levels through 2022 \nWe propose significant hires in Outreach & Research in 2020 and 2021 •Note: this chart reflects the \nmaximum  number of staff we \nmight have at each date. We \nrequest approval to budget \nconservatively – i.e., to have the \nopportunity to hire outstanding \nstaff if we have the opportunity – \nbut we think it is more likely than \nnot that we won’t hire this number \nof staff. \n•We are particularly uncertain \nabout future hiring in outreach. \n•As of August 2020 we have 41 \nemployees on staff. \n\n\nRevenue projections for 2020-2022 – approach – \nCategory Projected growth – best guess Projected growth rate \n– conservative Comments \nOpen Philanthropy Set at 20% of operating \nexpenses Same \nPrivate individual Set at 20% of operating \nexpenses Same May not continue to reach 20% of total budget as our budget \ngrows \nOther $100,000+ donors 2020: ($0.5m) decline \n2021: $0.1m growth \n2022: $0.4m growth 2020: Same \n2021: ($0.1m) decline \n2022: $0.1m growth 2020’s decline is a conservative estimate due to uncertainty \naround the economy’s impact on giving season. \nDonors giving $10,000 - $99,999 \n2020: 32% \n2021: 1% \n2022: 13% 2020: same \n2021: -3% \n2022: 2% The amount from this group has been quite variable, but \ngrowth in the number of donors suggests this category will at \nleast be maintained and will likely grow modestly. \nDonors giving $1,000 - $9,999 Same as above. \nDonors giving $100 - $999 Have seen sustained growth from this group. \nDonors giving under $100 Have seen high, sustained growth from this group. \nAnonymous donors Donations received without designations and without donor \ncontact information are recorded as unrestricted. \n\nBoard Decisions \n\nSummary of board votes \n1.Vote to approve 2020 (updated) and 2021 budgets \na.The 2020 budget was approved last year.

It has questions\nasked by board members (plain text) and responses\nfrom GiveWell (blue text).\nAdded for publishing: Links to referenced documents\nare available on the webpage with\nmaterials from the Board meeting.\n===========================================\nAgenda (previous version, sent to board members last\nweek)\nBased on the questions below, we are proposing a new\nagenda.\nNew agenda is here.\nAttachment A: Insurance Review and Sundry Items (attached—please\nreview)\nNo questions or comments.\nAttachment B: GiveWell's Recent Progress and Future\nPlans (please focus on the blue\nhighlights)\nS e c t i o n :\nMajor areas of growth => A potential additional\ngoal\nHolden says, \"I believe that GW can increase its impact\nsignificantly by helping OP and\nother major funders time their spending effectively.\nI think this could be considered as a\nfourth route to increased impact, and even if it doesn't\nhave quite the same absolute\npotential, I think it should be acknowledged as a\npriority that can rightfully compete with\nthese in value-for-effort terms.\"\nFirst, some context for Board members. Holden and\nI have been talking about this\npriority for a few months. Open Philanthropy has been\nworking on a project to estimate\nwhen to give to maximize impact over time (i.e., how\nshould it allocate its giving over the\n\nnext ~50 years). We've also had our biggest donor after Open Philanthropy ask us the\nsame question.\nOpen Philanthropy shared analysis with us concluding\nthat the potential humanitarian\nimpact of Open Philanthropy timing its giving better\nis very large (as large as or larger\nthan other major goals we're working on). We reviewed\nthat analysis and it seemed\nsound to us.\nAdditional information on this analysis was provided\nby Holden per a request from\nTim. It reads:\n“If you have $X (say, $1 billion) available\nto spend on GiveWell's top\ncharities, you can spend it all now, or invest it\nsuch that you end up spending a larger\namount later (due to investment returns), or do a\nmix (spend some now, invest the\nrest, spend some later).\nWhen you invest, you get more $ to spend later, but\nthe giving opportunities might be\nworse (due to the world getting better and $ flowing\nin from others)—or better (due to\nlearning over time and new interventions available\nalong the lines of bednets and\ndeworming).\nIt seems very nonobvious how these considerations\nnet out, and therefore what\nspending path (in terms of how much we spend vs. invest\neach year) will do as much\ngood as possible. Our modeling suggests that having\na better model could save a lot\nof net lives (I can get this shared if you'd like).\nI think GiveWell is best-positioned to\nhandle at least some aspects of getting a good model\nof the situation, in particular\nhow good we expect giving opportunities to be in the\nfuture.\nAlso noting that this question applies to all donors—if\nGiveWell had a view it really\nstood behind on how to optimally spread out donations\nvs. investing over time, it\ncould encourage many donors to incorporate that model.”\nOne way of thinking about this is that instead of\njust helping people decide how to\nallocate $ between charities, it could be helping\ndecide how to allocate $ between\nyears. Both choices can cause $ to go further.\nSince then, GiveWell has been contributing to this\nproject by researching how the\ncost-effectiveness and room for more funding of giving\nopportunities in global health\nhave changed over the past 20 years and estimating\nhow they might change in the\nfuture. I expect that we will continue to engage with\nOpen Philanthropy on this work.\nWe've allocated about half of one full-time researcher\nto this over the past three months.\nIt's possible we'd allocate more in the future.\n\nS e c t i o n\n: Major areas of growth => Finding more cost-effective giving opportunities\nBuddy says, \"Allocating sufficient talent and org\nresources against this goal is a critical\npredictor of success. Especially for new areas with\npotential for ~>30x cash, we should\nensure that the people in the org who can explore\n'open-ended' investigations are\nspending sufficient time on this, and/or have a plan\nfor training others to be able to.\"\nTim says, \"For clarity's sake, I think this word should\nbe 'additional' or we should\nseparate out the goals of finding opportunities at\nsimilar levels of cost-effectiveness\nversus ones with higher levels of cost-effectiveness\n(which may not have meaningful\namounts of room for more funding in terms of our growth).\"\nHolden says, \"FWIW, I think GW may want to prioritize\nfinding additional less\ncost-effective giving opportunities, to accommodate\npotentially dramatically increased $\nmoved. (Obviously, it's better if they can find all\nthe RFMF they need at similar levels of\ncost-effectiveness to today's top charities, but this\nmay not be possible).\"\nWe estimate that we will identify approximately $150\nmillion worth of giving opportunities\nin 2020 that have a cost-effectiveness of 10x cash\n(i.e., 10 times as cost-effective as\ndirect cash transfers) or higher. We also estimate\nthat we'll identify $11.5 million that is\n5-10x cash.\nSome context: we previously (in 2018 and 2019) believed\nthat this amount of room for\nmore funding would likely be sufficient to meet the\namount donors were giving via\nGiveWell's recommendations. Three things have changed:\n●\nMoney moved has continued to grow organically.\nFrom\n2015 to 2017, our\nmoney moved (excluding Open Philanthropy) stayed roughly\nflat, between $40\nand $45 million/year. In 2018, we saw significant\ngrowth (to $61 million), and our\ninitial estimates of 2019 money moved are that we\nsaw significant growth again\nin 2019 (to $80 million+\n). As far as we know, this\nis organic growth that isn't\n1\ndriven by any specific change. We don't know that\nit will continue, but over the\npast 10 years our money moved has consistently grown.\n●\nOur outreach team is beginning to move money.\nIn late\n2017, we began the\nprocess of building our outreach team. As the team\ngears up, we expect they will\nmove increasing amounts of money in the future.\n●\nOpen Philanthropy may give more to GiveWell's recommendations.\nOpen\nPhilanthropy has written that\nGiveWell's top charities\nare increasingly hard to\nbeat\n. Open Philanthropy wrote that it planned to allocate\n10% of its capital to\nstraightforward charity (most likely GiveWell's recommendations).\n1\nThis is an early estimate and may be due to an error.\nIt is subject to revision.\n\nOur goal in this area is to significantly increase the amount of very cost-effective room\nfor more funding that we can recommend to donors. We're currently using 10x cash as\nour benchmark for \"very cost-effective.\"\nWe have not yet assessed opportunities enough to have\na good sense of what we might\nbe able to find, but we're targeting finding $100m\nof additional (i.e., beyond the\napproximately $150 million room for more funding at\n10x+ by the end of 2022).\nS e c t i o n\n: Major areas of growth => New areas of research\nGW said: “\na) direct at least $25 million per year\nto opportunities that we believe are\nsignificantly more cost-effective than the top charity\nwe would have otherwise directed\nfunds to.”\nNorma says, \"Are you sure that you want the timeline\nto be two years? Or for the metric\nto be spending $25 million, versus simply having a\nclear view on whether new areas are\nworth significant additional investment? In my experience,\nchange in some of the areas\nyou're exploring can take several years. Additionally,\nfunders who are new to that work\nmay take time to learn and to develop relationships\nneeded to unlock certain impact\nopportunities. Finally, I have observed many funders\n(including GiveWell) sometimes\nlearn about new areas with smaller experimental grants.\nIf it would be helpful, I'm happy\nto talk about related experiences I've had in my grantmaking.\"\nTims says, \"This seems tautological and true now (e.g.,\nwe direct more money to our top\ncharities than to charities that are not our top charities).\nAlso would be helpful to have\nsome definition of what it takes to be 'significantly\nmore' rather than just 'more.'\"\nNorma says, \"I agree with Tim that eventually, defining\nthe standard for 'significantly\nmore' would be useful. I also think it will be helpful\nto decide how you approach\nopportunities where even after the grant, it will\nbe tough to assess the impact on lives\nand/or Givewell's contribution. Happy to talk about\nmy experience with this if that would\nbe helpful.\"\nOur goal is to move $25 million per year to opportunities\nthat we believe are at least 30\ntimes as cost-effective as cash transfers.\nCurrently, we estimate that the most cost-effective\ncountry-programs run by our top\ncharities are ~15-20x as cost-effective as cash transfers,\nand these programs (Deworm\nthe World in India and Kenya and parts of Helen Keller\nInternational's vitamin A\nsupplementation program) have ~$20 million of room\nfor funding.\nWe've been working on new areas of research since\nearly 2018, and we have made\nsome small/exploratory grants, so although our progress\nhas been slow, I believe we're\n\non track to make good decisions about giving $25 million in two years. (For context, we\nare currently evaluating two grants that total $13.5\nmillion, one in alcohol policy and one\nin pesticide regulation.)\nS e c t i o n :\nWhat constitutes success => Influencing institutional\nfunders\nGW said: “\nIf we achieve one of these goals, we consider\nthat to be in line with\nexpectations and a significant improvement in GiveWell's\noverall impact.”\nTim says, \"It's hard to agree that achieving one of\nthe three goals is 'success' when the\nthird goal is so (understandably) ill-defined at this\npoint.”\nHolden says, \"FWIW, I'd call it a success if they\naccomplish the current draft-goal under\n#3. OTOH, I don't think 1(b) would qualify.\"\n2\nI (Elie) agree that 1(b) doesn't qualify. If we achieve\nwhat's currently written under goal\n#3, I'd consider that success.\nOther questions\nSection:\nIncreasing money moved\nGW said: \"We also believe [GiveWell's] work on a direct\nmail and email campaign led to\napproximately another ~$1 million in donations; we\nhaven't yet analyzed this to be\nconfident.\" Julia asks, \"Is there a plan to evaluate\nit?\"\nWe have done analysis, but I wasn't able to collect\nthis information in time for this\ndocument. We'll report out after the board meeting.\nSection:\nHow has COVID-19 affected our progress?\nGW said: “We haven't yet published information on\nthe remaining grants (~$700,000 to\nIDinsight.” Tim asks, \"Have we created a statement\nor documented anything about\nconflicts of interest with IDinsight now that Buddy\nis on staff?\"\nWe have a\nrelationship disclosures\npage on our website\nwhich includes potential\nconflicts of interest for GiveWell staff and board\nwith grantees. We are explicit about\nthese relationships in grant write-ups and blog posts\nabout grants (e.g.,\nthis one\nreferencing a recent IDinsight grant).\n2\nI.e., \"conclude that the areas we're exploring are\nlikely less cost-effective than our top charities\n(or not \nsufficiently more cost-effective to be worth the effort\nof exploring this new area).\"\n\nAttachment C: GiveWell Compensation Review Protocol (please read in full)\nNo questions or comments.\nAttachment D: Compensation Review 2020 (please read\nin full)\nSection:\nSenior staff compensation\nTim asks, \"what accounts for the large differences\nbetween individuals in base/total?\"\nGiveWell covers the full cost of health insurance\nfor staff, their partners, and\ndependents. Staff who choose to take GiveWell's health\ninsurance and have partners\nand dependents on that insurance receive significant\nadditional compensation relative to\nthose who use alternative insurance (e.g., their partner's).\nEveryone receives a health\nreimbursement account for dental ($450 per staff person,\n$225 per dependent). They\nmay or may not actually request reimbursement in any\ngiven year.\n[A section here was redacted because it included individual\ncompensation information.]\nSection:\nCompensation overview => Top ten salaries\nTim writes: \"Note for board members: I am particularly\nconcerned about diversity of staff\nas GiveWell moves into possibly attempting to influence\npolicy in other countries and/or\ninfluencing large institutional donors who effectively\nmake or influence policy in other\ncountries.\"\nNorma adds, \"Tim—Another factor to consider is how\nmany staff have lived for extended\nperiods in low and middle income countries. Of course\nstaff who are from low and middle\nincome countries is better.\"\nDiversity has been a major topic of conversation internally.\nIt has been a major priority\nover the past year (and a high priority in previous\nyears), and we expect it to continue to\nbe a priority for the foreseeable future.\n●\nIn 2015, we recognized that\nwe had made a mistake\nby failing to prioritize staff\ndiversity in hiring, which led our staff to lack diversity\nin terms of gender, racial\nand ethnic background, and country of origin.\n●\nWe aimed to improve our diversity by (a) working to\nbuild a larger pool of\nqualified applicants and (b) creating and utilizing\nwork assignments that were\ngraded blindly as opposed to interviews as the key\ninputs to our hiring decisions.\n\nWe did other things as well, including working with consultants, but A and B are\nthe two actions that I believe had the biggest effects.\n●\nOur diversity improved, but we still aren't where\nwe would ideally be.\n●\nIn 2019, Whitney formed GiveWell's Diversity and Inclusion\nGroup to support this\nwork. This group has 9 members from all departments\nand across levels of\nseniority at GiveWell.\n●\nThis year, we have continued to prioritize increasing\ndiversity on staff, especially\nsenior staff. For example, we retained a recruiting\nfirm to explicitly search for\nsenior researchers from underrepresented backgrounds.\nAttachment E: GiveWell Foreign Registration Proposal\n(please read in full)\nRegarding the UK entity, Holden comments: \"I'm interested\nin some commentary on\nwhether there is any reason to worry that the UK board\nwill have powers traditionally in\nthe domain of the current board—for example, whether\nit will control a significant % of\nGiveWell's assets or will be able to put out its own\ncontent using GiveWell's brand.\"\nWe don’t expect this to be an area for concern. The\ntrustees of the UK entity will have\ncontrol over those funds that are donated specifically\nvia the UK entity but not over any\nassets held by GiveWell US.\nRegarding content, I believe the UK trustees would\nformally have the ability to develop\ncontent, but the likelihood of that happening would\nbe pretty slim, in part because the\nCEO will be a \"super trustee\" with the ability to\nappoint and dismiss the other trustees.\nThe way we have envisioned this with our legal counsel\nis that there would essentially be\nno operations (other than, likely, bookkeeping) conducted\nspecifically within/by the UK\nentity. The trustees of the UK entity would be expected\nto outsource operational issues\nto the GiveWell US entity. This minimizes requirements\non the trustees and\noptimizes/streamlines decisionmaking, brand consistency,\netc. It is possible that we may\nwant to develop tailored content for a UK audience,\nbut as currently envisioned, this\nwould be a decision made by and then executed by the\nUS-employed team.\nAttachment F: GiveWell Financial Summary and Slides\n(attached—please read in full)\nHolden asked, \"Question about Attachment F, Slide\n16: Is it intentional that the last five\nrows of donor categories share a single projection\nfor the next three years?\"\nYes, this was intentional and follows our practice\nfrom prior years. Because we engage\nless intensively with them, we don't have a meaningful\nway of assessing why a particular\nsub-$100k tier would grow at a different rate from\ndonors in another tier, so those\n\nprojections take into account the actuals in those tiers from the past several years and\nconsiderations of the expected economic conditions.\nThe further we project out, the more challenging the\neconomic forecasting becomes for\nthese categories in particular. Generally, we felt\nthat taking a very granular approach was\nnot likely to be more accurate or useful than a high-level\none due to the current\nuncertainty in the economy and the newness of our\nmarketing activities.\nAttachment H: Executive Compensation Review\nSection:\nFair Pay for Northern California Nonprofits\nTim commented on the table showing compensation data\nfrom Fair Pay, a salary survey\nfrom Northern California nonprofits: \"The difference\nbetween this number and the other\ncomparables is really large, more than 2x. It does\nmake me wonder how we are thinking\nabout comparables.\"\nI don't think that this salary survey represents a\ngroup of organizations that are\ncomparable to GiveWell in terms of their size or approach\nto compensation.\n●\nThe category of the largest organization in the Fair\nPay survey is organizations\nwith budgets of $15 million+. More than $50 million\nwas donated to GiveWell\ndirectly in 2019 (including both unrestricted and\nrestricted donations), and we\nmoved significantly more than $100 million.\n●\nWe compete for staff with other organizations that\npay well for the non-profit\nsector (e.g., foundations, the World Bank), and we\nbelieve we should pay\ncompetitively to attract talent. My impression is\nthat many nonprofits must or\nchoose to pay significantly lower salaries, which\nsignificantly limits the staff they\ncan potentially recruit.\nWe included this survey in service of transparency\nsince it represents how nonprofits in\nour region pay staff.\nAttachment I: Resolutions for Board Vote (please read\nin full)\nNo questions or comments.\nAttachment J: Minutes of the May 2020 Board meeting\n(attached—please review)\nNo questions or comments.\nNew questions\n\nJulia asks and Tim seconds: Possible topic: the research\non giving now vs. later might\nconflict with existing goals, which are basically\n“move money now.” If it turns out that it’s\nmore impactful to advise at least some donors to give\nlater, would overall goals need to\nbe adjusted to reflect this?\nGiveWell to follow up.\nBuilding on Buddy’s comment about staffing: To clarify,\ndo you feel you currently have\nthe human capacity you need for policy work and other\nnew areas?\nGiveWell to follow up.\nThe estimates on more opportunities to be found seem\nto be backwards—it seems odd\nthat we would find 10x more 10x opportunities than\n5x opportunities. Are we so confident\nin the inputs to that process?\nGiveWell to follow up."
