          "text": "\n6:34pm.  Meeting begins with all directors  (Bob,  Virginia,  Holden,  Lucy,\nGreg, Tim) present, as well as Program  Officer  Elie  Hassenfeld.   Because\nElie can only be present for the beginning  of  the  meeting,  introductions\nare postponed and Holden begins immediately with a discussion  of  the  most\npressing issue: the question of how the Clear  Fund  should  set  its  scope\n(how many and what causes it will cover) for  2007.   Holden  lays  out  the\noptions as he sees them (referring to Attachment D), and discussion ensues.\n\n6:52pm.  Holden  finishes  outlining  his  vision  for  the  two-step  grant\napplication process listed  as  Option  1  in  Attachment  D,  with  general\n(though not yet formal) agreement that this process is viable.  Elie  leaves\nthe meeting.\n\n7:19pm.  With general (still informal) agreement  about  the  shape  of  the\napplication process,  the  discussion  shifts  to  how  much  time  will  be\nrequired (and whether covering all five causes is viable).\n\n7:46pm.  The Board unanimously votes to approve the following plan:\n\nWithin one week after back and forth from the board,  we  will  send  out  a\npreliminary application asking for data relating to  specific  concepts  for\none program of the charity's choice.  We'll do this for at least 4 of the  5\ncauses.  They'll have 4 weeks to complete it.   We  will  respond  with  the\nfull application on a rolling basis, making sure to send  full  applications\nto only 10 charities per cause  (eliminating  the  rest  while  posting  our\nreasoning).  We'll give  them  6  weeks,  with  the  goal  of  beginning  to\nevaluate full applications by Sep. 15. October 31 the doors close  on  back-\nand-forth questioning.   Then we will cut  down  the  charities  to  10  per\ncause; we'll write full reviews of 5  per  cause  by  Thanksgiving,  have  a\nBoard meeting the week after Thanksgiving, and  give  out  grants  in  early\nDecember; we'll do site visits for the probable winner of  each  NYC  cause;\nwe'll do another site visit if we don’t like what we see, and  we'll  do  at\nleast one on-campus recruiting trip.\n\n7:47pm.  Board members introduce themselves.\n\n7:52pm.  Virginia Zink is formally (and unanimously) elected as Board Vice\nPresident and Treasurer.\n\n7:52pm.  Holden lays out the proposed 2007 Budget, referring to Attachment\nB.\n\n8:09pm.  Holden is dismissed from the room while the Board discusses the\nproposed salaries for him and Elie, referring to Attachment C.\n\n8:10pm.  The salaries are approved, and Holden re-enters the room.\nDiscussion of the budget continues.\n\n8:22pm.  Proposed budget (see Attachment B) is approved with the following\ncaveats:\n\n    • Trip to Africa is eliminated\n    • Executive Director has authority to make minor changes and be held\n      accountable at later meetings\n    • This budget is valid through CY 2007 only, and future plans will\n      depend on receipts in December, which will be discussed at a later\n      Board meeting.  We are all aware of the possibility that the project\n      may be put on hold after the website is constructed in December.\n\n8:24pm.  Meeting is adjourned.\n"

I have received a copy of the conflict of interest policy for The Clear\nFund.\nB. I have read and understand the conflict of interest policy for The Clear\nFund.\nC. I have agreed to comply with the conflict of interest policy for The\nClear Fund.\nD. I understand that The Clear Fund is charitable and in order to maintain\nits federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which\naccomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.\n\n___________________________________\n(Signature)\n___________________________________\n(Date)\n___________________________________\n(Print name)\n\n           Conflict of Interest and Compensation Approval Policies\n\nSection 1. Purpose of Conflict of Interest Policy\n\nThe purpose of this conflict of interest policy is to protect this tax-\nexempt corporation's interest when it is contemplating entering into a\ntransaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an\nofficer or director of the corporation or any \"disqualified person\" as\ndefined in Section 4958(f)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code and as amplified\nby Section 53.4958-3 of the IRS Regulations and which might result in a\npossible \"excess benefit transaction\" as defined in Section 4958(c)(1)(A)\nof the Internal Revenue Code and as amplified by Section 53.4958 of the IRS\nRegulations. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any\napplicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable\nto nonprofit and charitable organizations.\n\nSpecifically, there may be no transaction(s) in which any board or staff\nmembers have material conflicting interests with the charity resulting from\nany relationship or business affiliation. Factors that will be considered\nwhen concluding whether or not a related party transaction constitutes a\nconflict of interest and if such a conflict is material, include, but are\nnot limited to: any arm's length procedures established by the charity; the\nsize of the transaction relative to like expenses of the charity; whether\nthe interested party participated in the board vote on the transaction; if\ncompetitive bids were sought and whether the transaction is one-time,\nrecurring or ongoing.\n\nSection 2. Definitions\n\na. Interested Person. Any director, principal officer, member of a\ncommittee with governing board delegated powers, or any other person who is\na \"disqualified person\" as defined in Section 4958(f)(1) of the Internal\nRevenue Code and as amplified by Section 53.4958-3 of the IRS Regulations,\nwho has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an\ninterested person.\n\nb. Financial Interest. A person has a financial interest if the person has,\ndirectly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:\n\n1. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the\ncorporation has a transaction or arrangement,\n\n2. A compensation arrangement with the corporation or with any entity or\nindividual with which the corporation has a transaction or arrangement, or\n\n3. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation\narrangement with, any entity or individual with which the corporation is\nnegotiating a transaction or arrangement.\nCompensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or\nfavors that are not insubstantial.\n\nA financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Under\nSection 3, paragraph B, a person who has a financial interest may have a\nconflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board or committee\ndecides that a conflict of interest exists.\n\nSection 3. Conflict of Interest Avoidance Procedures\n\na. Duty to Disclose. In connection with any actual or possible conflict of\ninterest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial\ninterest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the\ndirectors and members of committees with governing board delegated powers\nconsidering the proposed transaction or arrangement.\n\nb. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. After disclosure of\nthe financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion\nwith the interested person, he/she shall leave the governing board or\ncommittee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is\ndiscussed and voted upon. The remaining board or committee members shall\ndecide if a conflict of interest exists.\n\nc. Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest. An interested person\nmay make a presentation at the governing board or committee meeting, but\nafter the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting during the\ndiscussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving\nthe possible conflict of interest.\n\nThe chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate,\nappoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to\nthe proposed transaction or arrangement.\n\nAfter exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall\ndetermine whether the corporation can obtain with reasonable efforts a more\nadvantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would\nnot give rise to a conflict of interest.\n\nIf a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably\npossible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the\ngoverning board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the\ndisinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the\ncorporation's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair\nand reasonable. In conformity with the above determination, it shall make\nits decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.\n\nd. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy. If the governing board\nor committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to\ndisclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the\nmember of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to\nexplain the alleged failure to disclose.\n\nIf, after hearing the member's response and after making further\ninvestigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or\ncommittee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or\npossible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and\ncorrective action.\n\nSection 4. Records of Board and Board Committee Proceedings\n\nThe minutes of meetings of the governing board and all committees with\nboard delegated powers shall contain:\n\na. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a\nfinancial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of\ninterest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to\ndetermine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the governing\nboard's or committee's decision as to whether a conflict of interest in\nfact existed.\n\nb. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes\nrelating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion,\nincluding any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and\na record of any votes taken in connection with the proceedings.\n\nSection 5. Compensation Approval Policies\n\nA voting member of the governing board who receives compensation, directly\nor indirectly, from the corporation for services is precluded from voting\non matters pertaining to that member's compensation.\n\nA voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation\nmatters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the\ncorporation for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to\nthat member's compensation.\n\nNo voting member of the governing board or any committee whose jurisdiction\nincludes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or\nindirectly, from the corporation, either individually or collectively, is\nprohibited from providing information to any committee regarding\ncompensation.\n\nWhen approving compensation for directors, officers and employees,\ncontractors, and any other compensation contract or arrangement, in\naddition to complying with the conflict of interest requirements and\npolicies contained in the preceding and following sections of this article\nas well as the preceding paragraphs of this section of this article, the\nboard or a duly constituted compensation committee of the board shall also\ncomply with the following additional requirements and procedures:\n\na. The terms of compensation shall be approved by the board or compensation\ncommittee prior to the first payment of compensation,\n\nb. All members of the board or compensation committee who approve\ncompensation arrangements must not have a conflict of interest with respect\nto the compensation arrangement as specified in IRS Regulation Section\n53.4958-6(c)(iii), which generally requires that each board member or\ncommittee member approving a compensation arrangement between this\norganization and a \"disqualified person\" (as defined in Section 4958(f)(1)\nof the Internal Revenue Code and as amplified by Section 53.4958-3 of the\nIRS Regulations):\n\n      1. is not the person who is the subject of the compensation\n      arrangement, or a family member of such person;\n\n\n      2. is not in an employment relationship subject to the direction or\n      control of the person who is the subject of the compensation\n      arrangement;\n\n\n      3. does not receive compensation or other payments subject to approval\n      by the person who is the subject of the compensation arrangement;\n\n\n      4. has no material financial interest affected by the compensation\n      arrangement; and\n\n\n      5. does not approve a transaction providing economic benefits to the\n      person who is the subject of the compensation arrangement, who in turn\n      has approved or will approve a transaction providing benefits to the\n      board or committee member.\n\nc. The board or compensation committee shall obtain and rely upon\nappropriate data as to comparability prior to approving the terms of\ncompensation. Appropriate data may include the following:\n\n      1. Compensation levels paid by similarly situated organizations, both\n      taxable and tax-exempt, for functionally comparable positions.\n      \"Similarly situated\" organizations are those of a similar size,\n      purpose, and with similar resources.\n\n\n      2. The availability of similar services in the geographic area of this\n      organization.\n\n\n      3. Current compensation surveys compiled by independent firms.\n\n\n      4. Actual written offers from similar institutions competing for the\n      services of the person who is the subject of the compensation\n      arrangement.\n\nAs allowed by IRS Regulation 4958-6, if this organization has average\nannual gross receipts (including contributions) for its three prior tax\nyears of less than $1 million, the board or compensation committee will\nhave obtained and relied upon appropriate data as to comparability if it\nobtains and relies upon data on compensation paid by three comparable\norganizations in the same or similar communities for similar services.\n\nd. The terms of compensation and the basis for approving them shall be\nrecorded in written minutes of the meeting of the board or compensation\ncommittee that approved the compensation. Such documentation shall include:\n\n\n      1. The terms of the compensation arrangement and the date it was\n      approved.\n\n\n      2. The members of the board or compensation committee who were present\n      during debate on the transaction, those who voted on it, and the votes\n      cast by each board or committee member.\n\n\n      3. The comparability data obtained and relied upon and how the data\n      was obtained.\n\n\n      4. If the board or compensation committee determines that reasonable\n      compensation for a specific position in this organization or for\n      providing services under any other compensation arrangement with this\n      organization is higher or lower than the range of comparability data\n      obtained, the board or committee shall record in the minutes of the\n      meeting the basis for its determination.\n\n\n      5. If the board or committee makes adjustments to comparability data\n      due to geographic area or other specific conditions, these adjustments\n      and the reasons for them shall be recorded in the minutes of the board\n      or committee meeting.\n\n\n      6. Any actions taken with respect to determining if a board or\n      committee member had a conflict of interest with respect to the\n      compensation arrangement, and if so, actions taken to make sure the\n      member with the conflict of interest did not affect or participate in\n      the approval of the transaction (for example, a notation in the\n      records that after a finding of conflict of interest by a member, the\n      member with the conflict of interest was asked to, and did, leave the\n      meeting prior to a discussion of the compensation arrangement and a\n      taking of the votes to approve the arrangement).\n\n\n      7. The minutes of board or committee meetings at which compensation\n      arrangements are approved must be prepared before the later of the\n      date of the next board or committee meeting or 60 days after the final\n      actions of the board or committee are taken with respect to the\n      approval of the compensation arrangements. The minutes must be\n      reviewed and approved by the board and committee as reasonable,\n      accurate, and complete within a reasonable period thereafter, normally\n      prior to or at the next board or committee meeting following final\n      action on the arrangement by the board or committee.\n\nSection 6. Annual Statements\n\nEach director, principal officer, and member of a committee with governing\nboard delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which affirms such\nperson:\na. has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,\nb. has read and understands the policy,\nc. has agreed to comply with the policy, and\nd. understands the corporation is charitable and in order to maintain its\nfederal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which\naccomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.\n\nSection 7. Periodic Reviews\n\nTo ensure the corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable\npurposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-\nexempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews\nshall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:\na. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on\ncompetent survey information, and the result of arm's-length bargaining.\nb. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management\norganizations conform to the corporation's written policies, are properly\nrecorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services,\nfurther charitable purposes, and do not result in inurement, impermissible\nprivate benefit, or in an excess benefit transaction.\n\nSection 8. Use of Outside Experts\n\nWhen conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Section 7, the\ncorporation may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are\nused, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its responsibility\nfor ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.\n"

          "text": "Clear Fund Board Meeting 6/22/07 \nAttachment C: Review of Compensation \n \nContext \n \nI. Executive Director compensation for 3 comparable organizations \n \nAlthough the Clear Fund is an unconventional organization, Holden Karnofsky, asked \nJason McGill, Director of Membership at the New York Regional Association of \nGrantmakers, to name appropriate comparables.  Their exchange is attached.  Jason \nnamed four organizations, of which we were able to locate Form 990s (relevant pages \nattached) for three, with the stipulation that the Clear Fund's budget – and therefore \nappropriate compensation – is lower than that of these comparables. \n \nNew York Women's Foundation, a small public foundation located in New York \nCity. \no Total expenses: $3,023,293.00. \no Executive Director compensation (excluding benefits): $129,231.00 for 40 \nhrs/week. \no Program Director compensation (excluding benefits): $87,258.00 for 40 \nhrs/week. \nThird Wave Foundation, a small public foundation located in New York City. \no Total expenses: $657,468.00 \no Executive Director compensation: $51,827.00 for 40 hrs/week. \no Other officer compensation: N/A. \nNorth Star Fund, a small public foundation located in New York City. \no Total expenses: $1,072,280.00 \no Executive Director compensation: $67,015.00 for 40 hrs/week. \no Other officer compensation: N/A. \n \nII. Data from NPCCNY's salary survey \n \nCraig Weinrich of the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York, in an exchange \nwith Holden Karnofsky (attached), disclosed the following data about salaries at \nnonprofits with budgets and areas of focus comparable to those of The Clear Fund. \n \nFor nonprofits in the area of health and human services with annual budgets \nbetween $400,000 and $700,000, the median Executive Director salary is $68,000 \n(ann.); the median Deputy Director salary is $48,000 (ann.) \nFor nonprofits in the area of public societal benefit with annual budgets between \n$400,000 and $700,000, the median Executive Director salary is $74,000 (ann.); \nDeputy Director data is not available. \n \nIII. Roles of Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld \n \n\nThe Clear Fund's 2007 budget is approximately $250,000; on an annualized basis, this \ntranslates to approximately $500,000. \n \nHolden Karnofsky will serve as Executive Director, and expects to work approximately \n80 hours per week.  Elie Hassenfeld will serve as Program Officer, and expects to work \nin excess of 60 hours per week. \n \nProposal \n \nHolden Karnofsky, Executive Director: An annualized salary of $68,600 (including \nbenefits). \n \nElie Hassenfeld, Program Officer: An annualized salary of $68,600 (including \nbenefits). \n \nThese salaries are within range of the comparable salaries discussed above. \n \nBefore voting \n \nBefore voting on the proposal regarding compensation, please affirm each of the \nfollowing: \n \n1. I am not the person who is the subject of the compensation arrangement, or a \nfamily member of such person;  \n \n2. I am not in an employment relationship subject to the direction or control of the \nperson who is the subject of the compensation arrangement; \n \n3. I do not receive compensation or other payments subject to approval by the \nperson who is the subject of the compensation arrangement; \n \n4. I have no material financial interest affected by the compensation arrangement; \nand \n \n5. I am not approving a transaction providing economic benefits to the person \nwho is the subject of the compensation arrangement, who in turn has approved or \nwill approve a transaction providing benefits to the board or committee member.  \n\nExchange between Holden Karnofsky and Jason McGill of NYRAG \nHi Holden: \n  \nEach of the following organizations runs a budget that is currently larger than \nThe Clear Fund,  but each is a relatively modest-sized public foundation and is \ntherefore in the ballpark, grantmaking-wise, of what I understand to be your first \ngrantmaking plateau goal for the Fund.  I think these would make a reasonable \ncomparison for due diligence on compensation (although you'll likely set your \nsalary below what these folks make). \n  \nYou should be able to find their 990s online.  Let me know if the numbers leave \nyou needing additional examples. \n  \nNew York Women's Foundation \nThe North Star Fund \nTwenty-First Century Foundation \nThird Wave Foundation \n  \n  \nYrs-- \n  \nJason \n  \n_______________________________________ \nJason McGill \nDirector, Member Services \nNYRAG: New York Regional Association of Grantmakers \n79 Fifth Avenue, Fourth Floor \nNew York, NY 10003 \nPhone: 212/714-0699 x 203 \nFax: 212/239-2075 \ne-mail: jmcgill@nyrag.org \nWeb: www.nyrag.org \nplease consider the environment before printing this e-mail \n \n \nFrom: holden0@gmail.com [mailto:holden0@gmail.com] On Behalf Of Holden \nSent: Wednesday, June 20, 2007 11:59 AM \nTo: Jason McGill \nSubject: Comparables for The Clear Fund \n\nHi Jason, \n \nThanks again for speaking with me just now.  As I mentioned over the phone, we are \nlooking for the names of nonprofit organizations that would be appropriate comparables \nfor The Clear Fund, for the purpose of setting an appropriate level of compensation for \nour officers.

Economic opportunity for adults in NYC: ~50\n\nPossible courses of action, in order of Holden's preference:\n\n\nOur options\n\n\n   1. Design the grant application process with an initial \"screening\"\n      round, rigidly committing to eliminating a large number of\n      organizations with very limited information.\n   2. Drop one or more of our core causes.\n   3. Proceed with all five causes, and decide on the fly whether to modify\n      our application process, narrow our scope, drop causes, or postpone\n      until 2008.  Being straightforward with applicants about the\n      uncertainty is important.\n   4. Decide now to postpone our launch date past December of 2007.\n   5. Narrow our scope by addressing subsets of our core causes (for\n      example, water and sanitation only for core cause #1).\n   6. Recruit more staff.\n\n\n\n\nDetails on the organizations within each core cause\n\n\n\nGuiding principles:\n\n    • Direct humanitarian aid.  We seek to translate money into better\n      lives, without reliance on advocacy, research, or education/outreach\n      to the general public.\n    • Enabling lives of full opportunity.  We seek to help people who could\n      be or do anything; while we did not filter out charities that\n      discriminate by ethnicity or gender, we did filter out charities that\n      focus on the elderly and infirm, or the terminally ill and irrevocably\n      disabled.\n    • Geographical focus.  We are focusing on NYC and Africa.\n    • Scalability.  We are looking for charities that already have\n      activities that are capable of expanding with more money.  We've thus\n      focused on larger charities.\n\nWhat the numbers below represent: # charities that have  actively  expressed\npotential interest in a grant  of  $20,000  to  $50,000,  using  our  online\nsurveys         at          http://preapplication.clearfund.org          and\nhttp://international.clearfund.org , and were  not  disqualified  either  by\ngeography (organizations that explicitly do not  serve  Africa  or  NYC  are\ndisqualified) or answers to other survey questions (specified below).\n\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n[pic]\n\nDoes not include 7 big-name organizations that have not registered (but\nthat we plan to contact) – 5 in general relief, 2 in microfinance.\n\n\nEssential categories:\n\n    • Saving lives – 70-80 qualifying orgs\n    • Economic opportunity - ~45 qualifying orgs\n\n\nDomestic\n\n\n[pic]\n\n\n    • Does not include 17 big-name organizations that we plan to contact (9\n      in adult categories, 6 in K-12, 2 in preschool category).\n    • #1, #2, #3, #5: eliminated orgs that focus exclusively on the elderly,\n      disabled, and/or terminally ill (incl HIV)\n    • #1: also eliminated orgs that provide permanent but not temporary\n      housing\n    • #4, #6, #7: eliminated orgs that focus specifically on special-needs\n      children\n    • #6: also eliminated orgs that don't focus specifically on low-income\n      families\n    • #7: also eliminated orgs that didn't submit any information on\n      relevant activities\n\n\nMore detail on category #7\n\n\n[pic]\n\nEssential categories:\n    • Educational opportunities for children (K-12) - ~70 qualifying orgs\n    • Early child development (preschool) - ~25 qualifying orgs\n    • Helping adults - ~50 qualifying orgs\n\n\nDetails on how this data set was produced\n\n\n1. Formed initial guiding principles for filtering charities.\n    • Direct humanitarian aid.  We seek to translate money into better\n      lives, without reliance on advocacy, research, or education/outreach\n      to the general public.\n    • Enabling lives of full opportunity.  We seek to help people who could\n      be or do anything; while we did not filter out charities that\n      discriminate by ethnicity or gender, we did filter out charities that\n      focus on the elderly and infirm, or the terminally ill and irrevocably\n      disabled.\n    • Geographical focus.  We are focusing on NYC and Africa.\n    • Scalability.  We are looking for charities that already have\n      activities that are capable of expanding with more money.  We've thus\n      focused on larger charities.\n\n2. Purchased a set of 3502 records from GuideStar.  Nonprofits were\nfiltered by their NTEE classification (we handpicked the ones that looked\nrelevant based on the above criteria), as well as a combination of budget\nand geographical region (we looked at all charities with 2005 expenses over\n$50 million; all charities in relevant international categories with 2005\nexpenses over $1 million; and all charities that were both in relevant\ndomestic categories and located in New York State with 2005 expenses over\n$1 million).\n\n3. Went through the data set by hand, reading the nonprofits' mission\nstatements and statements of accomplishments.  We filtered out nonprofits\nthat seemed to clearly violate the above criteria, while also constructing\na set of questions to classify them more accurately.\n\n4. Used a combination of this data set and other sources (personal\nrecommendations, FastCompany Social Entrepreneur Awards) to produce a list\nof 1023 addresses (663 in domestic causes, 113 in international causes).\nSent a letter to each of these addresses (international letters were mailed\n6/11/07 am; domestic were mailed 6/12/07 pm) briefly explaining the Clear\nFund and pointing them to our online survey.  33 of the letters have been\nreturned as undeliverable as of 6/21/07.\n\n5. Exported the survey data: 300 unique organizations (187 in domestic\ncauses, 113 in international causes).  Disqualified organizations that\nexplicitly do not work in NYC or Africa.\n"

Introductions and elections.  5-10 minutes unless there are\nunanticipated disagreements.\n\n2. Causes.  Allow one hour.\n\nThis is an  extremely  debatable  and  important  decision:  what  charities\nshould be eligible for Clear Fund grants?   Holden  will  present  different\noptions and relevant statistics on the charities (Attachment  D)  that  have\nexpressed preliminary interest.  We need to finalize the  causes  the  Clear\nFund will address, balancing several factors:\n\n   A. Helping as many humanitarian donors as possible, consistent with the\n      Clear Fund's mission.\n   B. Respecting the philosophical values (and demands) of our existing\n      donors.\n   C. Investigating charities with enough variety that the Clear Fund can\n      create definite value-added with its analysis.\n   D. Being realistic about what can be done well by December.\n\n3. Timeline and general project plan.  Allow one hour.\n\nHolden proposes to send out grant applications on Monday, June 25, and\nfocus on general research on the causes until August, with the aim of\ncreating a brief writeup on what he's found for each cause.\n\nIn August, Elie Hassenfeld's employment with the Clear Fund will begin, and\nboth Holden and Elie will focus on reviewing and questioning grantees\nthrough October.  These months will also include Holden traveling to Africa\nfor approximately a week, and Holden and Elie conducting an on-campus\nrecruiting trip to build capacity.\n\nNovember will be spent designing and creating the content for the Clear\nFund's website, and December will be spent entirely on publicity and\nfundraising.\n\nAs Executive Director, Holden will have authority to make  tactical  changes\nin the plan, so long as he is accountable for them at future  meetings.   He\nwill  be  solely  responsible  for  designing  and   executing   the   grant\napplication process.\n\n5. Review of budget.  20min unless there are unanticipated disagreements.\n\nHolden will go over the budget (Attachment B) at a conceptual level.\nPoints to highlight include:\n\n   A. Very little allowance for website design and marketing.\n   B. Accounting is a major expense.  We should agree on the priorities.\n      Holden moves to retain a firm for help with initial setup, for ~$5000,\n      but to try to stay under $250,000 in gross receipts for 2007, in the\n      interest of having the option to perform less than a full audit.\n   C. The size of grants will remain indeterminate, but is set at $20,000\n      for now.\n   D. We should make sure we agree on the worthiness of other items, notably\n      a trip to Africa and a recruiting trip in the fall.\n\n6. Review of compensation.  5min unless there are unanticipated\ndisagreements.\n\nHolden  will  recuse  himself  from  the  room,  after  providing   relevant\nmaterials (Attachment C) for considering his proposal to pay  him  and  Elie\n$68,600 (annualized; incl. benefits) each.\n\n                  Total projected meeting time: 150 minutes\n                  Next meeting: the week after Thanksgiving\n\nAttachments to be sent:\n   A. Annual statements\n   B. Budget\n   C. Review of Compensation\n   D. Determining the Clear Fund's Scope\n"

Why not one of a trillion\nother charities? Is there any evidence that improving school supplies\nimproves education? Is this a better idea than improving the teachers\nthemselves (Teach for America) or reworking the schools (KIPP, Achievement\nFirst)?”)\n\nWe also criticized Charity Navigator’s methodology in many cases.\n\nIn all of these instances, we used handles that were variations on Holden\nor Elie, and when possible linked our names directly to www.givewell.net .\nWe were making no attempts to hide our identities, and expected anyone who\nfollowed our comments to become aware of them.  However, we did not\ndisclose our backgrounds and affiliations in our comments.  We were\nmistaken not to do this.\n\nElie sent one email to the Boing Boing blog that promoted GiveWell without\nidentifying his role in the project (although it did use his real name).\n\n\n\nOn 12/30/2007 and 12/31/2007, I carried out three more deceptive forms of\nadvertising:\n\n    • I sent ten emails to bloggers using an email account I had recently\n      created for Teel Lidow, claiming that www.givewell.net had recently\n      helped me to make a year-end donation and recommending that they (the\n      bloggers) post about it.\n\n    • I made two comments on the Lifehacker blog under the handle Geremiah.\n      One asked for guidance in finding a charity; the other, in response to\n      a post on Charity Navigator, criticized Charity Navigator and pointed\n      to GiveWell.\n\n    • I posted a question to Ask Metafilter under the name Geremiah, asking\n      for help finding a good charity for a year-end donation.  I then\n      signed out and created a new account, Holden0, and responded under\n      this account, recommending GiveWell (without explicitly identifying\n      myself as the founder).  Finally, I signed back in as Geremiah, marked\n      the Holden0 response as “best answer,” and responded critically to a\n      comment by Miko suggesting that “Geremiah” ask a more specific\n      question.\n\nMy intent was to generate attention and traffic for GiveWell.  I did not\nintend for anyone to make a financial or other commitment based on my\nfalsely represented comments; I intended for these comments to be\nintriguing enough to make people investigate GiveWell.net for themselves\nand judge it on the merits.  I created obfuscation to promote interest; I\nunderestimated the extent to which many associate anonymity with\nobjectivity.\n\nAll of this behavior was wrong.  I was overzealous in my enthusiasm to\npromote GiveWell, and violated the principle of honesty, which is very\nimportant to me.  I deeply regret this behavior and I am committed to never\nagain promoting a project of mine without identifying my connection to it\nup front.\n\n\n\nOn 12/31/2007, MetaFilter member Miko uncovered my actions on Ask\nMetafilter, and opened a MetaTalk thread to discuss them.  Having had my\ntwo MetaFilter accounts deleted, I created a third (holden00), identified\nmyself, apologized for my actions, and asked for suggestions on how I could\nmake up for my breach of the community rules.  I offered a donation,\nstating, “I'm not offering this in return for your ceasing your criticism,\nI'm offering it to make up for abusing the rules,” and retracted the offer\nimmediately upon comments that it was perceived as a “bribe” offer.\n\nOn a MetaFilter member’s suggestion, I posted an apology to the GiveWell\nblog.  The apology initially was only for the misbehavior on MetaFilter.\nAfter a poster requested that I disclose all behavior that falls under the\nheading of “astroturfing,” I edited my apology to disclose all of the other\nactivity mentioned above: my emails to bloggers, my comments on the\nLifehacker blog, and my earlier comments that identified me to interested\nparties but did not put my affiliation up front.\n\n\n\nAside from the behavior on Ask MetaFilter, every instance of astroturfing\nthat has been found by the MetaFilter community was brought up by me before\nanyone else found it (in category and general nature; my apology did not\nlist specific locations and quotes).[1]\n\n\n\nThis is a complete account of my relevant behavior.\n\n-----------------------\n[1] Some of the comments that I made as “Holden,” but that had inadequate\ndisclosure, were found by others before my revised mea culpa.  This\nclarification was not in the original version of this document, but the\nBoard is aware of it.\n\n"

We  are  committed  to\nthe goals of improving  philanthropy  and  increasing  transparency  in  the\nsector by publicly sharing our process,  our  criteria,  our  methodologies,\nour deliberations, and our findings. Furthermore,  we  remain  committed  to\nengaging in public dialogue about  how  best  to  achieve  these  goals  and\nencourage continued comment about our organization’s work.\nThe Board believes that the acts of misrepresentation  that  were  committed\nare  indefensible  and  are  in  direct  conflict  with  the  goals  of  the\norganization, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.\nThe board apologizes for any violations of public trust resulting  from  Mr.\nKarnofsky’s actions.\nEffective January 3, 2008,  Holden  Karnofsky  has  been  removed  from  his\nposition as Executive Director of GiveWell and from his  position  as  Board\nSecretary. The Executive Director position is now  vacant;  Tim  Ogden  will\nserve as interim Board Secretary. In addition  to  being  removed  from  his\npositions, a financial penalty has been imposed on Mr. Karnofsky.  While  we\nare removing him from the Executive Director position, we believe  that  his\nprevious contributions outside of the acts noted above have  demonstrated  a\ncommitment to the goals of the  organization  and  have  been  important  to\naccomplishing GiveWell’s work. As a  result,  Holden  will  be  moved  to  a\nProgram Officer position, where we believe he will be  valuable  in  helping\nGiveWell meet its outstanding commitments to applicants and donors. He  will\nalso participate in a program of professional development and mentoring.\nIn response to the actions by Elie Hassenfeld which were  inconsistent  with\nGiveWell’s core values of transparency and honesty, the  board  has  decided\nto impose a financial penalty. We believe  that  Mr.  Hassenfeld’s  previous\ncommitment to the goals of GiveWell demonstrates that  he  can  continue  to\nmake a positive contribution to the work of the organization in  the  future\nin his current role as a program officer.\nThe GiveWell Board of Directors will begin meeting bi-weekly to develop  and\napprove operating plans for  GiveWell  and  to  discuss  the  organization’s\nstrategy and future. We will institute an  organization-wide  communications\npolicy that will mandate  that  all  staff  and  members  of  the  Board  of\nDirectors explicitly disclose their affiliation with the  organization  when\ncommunicating with others. The policy will be made public once it  has  been\ncompleted.\nWe would also like to make clear to all donors to GiveWell since December  1\nthat we will contact them directly  about  these  recent  changes  and  will\nprovide them the opportunity to have their gift returned if they so  choose.\n\nSigned,\nBob Elliott, Chairman\nGreg Jensen, Treasurer\nTim Ogden, Interim Secretary\nLucy Bernholz\nVirginia Ford\nIn addition to the above statement from the Board of Directors as  a  whole,\nwe would like to separately add the following about Holden’s actions,  given\nour greater personal experience with him than other board members’.\nWe would like to make clear that the actions that  Holden  took  to  conceal\nhis identity were  improper  and  indefensible,  as  were  his  attempts  to\nameliorate the situation by offering a financial contribution.\nWhile in this situation Holden acted improperly, we would like to  emphasize\nthat we believe Holden’s commitment to the GiveWell cause is genuine.  Those\nwho have commented that his involvement in GiveWell is an attempt to  run  a\nscam on the public or to gain financially are simply wrong. His  substantial\nsacrifices financially and personally to take GiveWell from  an  idea  to  a\nreality demonstrate his passion for the values of the organization.\nIn addition, we would like to emphasize that we believe  and  have  seen  in\naction his stated commitment to the values of openness  and  honesty.  While\nthere  are  many  incidents  where  Holden  did  not  clearly  identify  his\naffiliation with the organization, we view these actions to  be  the  result\nof his core mistake of thinking improperly about how  to  represent  himself\nwhen communicating online.\nIn our previous professional and personal experiences with  Holden,  he  has\nshown directness and honesty with those around him, and  demanded  the  same\nfrom others. He has acknowledged weaknesses and  worked  with  sincerity  to\nimprove those limitations. And, in the past when he has  realized  that  his\nbehavior or thinking was wrong, he not only been willing to change his  mind\nand accept explicit personal responsibility, but take steps to  ensure  that\nsimilar action does not happen again.\nIt is clear to us that he has  realized  that  his  actions  were  improper,\ntaken responsibility for his actions, and is committed to making  sure  that\nhe communicates in a way that holds  true  to  the  values  of  honesty  and\ntransparency moving forward. We know Holden is  committed  to  these  values\nand expect that he will demonstrate to the community that this behavior  was\nnot consistent with his character through his continued work at GiveWell.\nWe recognize that people can make mistakes and that they can learn  powerful\nlessons from those failures. When  we  think  about  the  whole  picture  of\nHolden, and view  his  mistakes  in  the  context  of  his  contribution  to\nGiveWell so far as well as his character prior to this project,  we  believe\nthat he will continue to make a positive impact for the organization in  the\nfuture.\nBob Elliott, Chairman\nGreg Jensen, Treasurer\n\n"

All\nhave been methodologically strong, with moderate attrition  and  blind  data\ncollection.   Populations  served  have  varied  widely,  though  all   have\ninvolved  low-income   first-time   mothers.    All   three   trials   found\nstatistically significant effects on mothers’  “birth  spacing”  (number  of\nchildren, months between births), and two found effects on mothers’  use  of\nwelfare that were attributed to the effects on birth spacing.  In  addition,\nall three trials found that treated children were better off in  some  ways,\nthough  they  often  looked  at  many  factors   and   found   statistically\nsignificant differences on only a few  (while  still  more  than  one  would\nprobabilistically expect with no effect).\n\nThe first trial, in Elmira County NY, followed families for 15  years  after\nbirth  and   found   statistically   significant   effects   on   children’s\ndisciplinary records (though few differences  in  their  reported  behavior,\nsuch as sex and drug use).  The second, in Memphis, has so far published  3-\nand 6-year follow-ups (the latter published in 2004 – so we hope and  expect\nthat more are on the way), and found the  children  of  visited  mothers  to\nhave  superior  scores  on  a  variety  of   tests   including   vocabulary,\narithmetic, and a  mental  processing  composite.   The  third,  in  Denver,\npublished the results  of  its  4-year  followup  in  2004,  and  found  the\nchildren of visited mothers to have superior scores on a  variety  of  tests\nincluding language and behavioral adaptation in testing.\n\nOther studies of similar  programs  have  found  much  weaker  results;  the\nhypothesis we have seen advanced in the literature is  that  the  difference\nbetween registered nurses and paraprofessionals is  important.   The  Denver\nstudy of NFP provides preliminary direct evidence for this,  by  randomizing\nbetween the two treatments; while both have some positive  effects  on  both\nmothers and children, it is reported  (from  a  paper  that  we  don’t  have\naccess to) that paraprofessional effects are about half as large.\n\nApparent  effects  on  visited  mothers’  children  are   often   relatively\nsmall/haphazard (i.e., they look at many variables and find a  few  pointing\nstrongly in the direction of the treated group, with the rest  statistically\nequivalent); at the same time, expecting  much  more  from  an  intervention\nlike this is probably excessive, and NFP’s studies are cited throughout  the\nliterature as being the methodologically strongest  and  most  promising  in\nterms  of  outcomes  (and  have  been  reproduced  across   very   different\npopulations).  We would bet that this program is having lasting  effects  of\nsome size on people’s lives, and that it  is  more  effective  than  similar\nprograms.\n\n                                    Costs\n\nNFP’s website puts the cost of the program  at  $10,000  per  family,  total\n(for the 2.75- year program).  Its sample startup budget is around  $500,000\nper year for 100 families, which implies a total cost of about  $14,000  for\nthe full program.  Note that most of the costs are paid  by  the  individual\nagencies; the role of the national  organization  is  to  provide  training,\nsupport, and oversight, and its  costs  are  negligible  in  the  scheme  of\nthings (around $10m for 75,000 families next year).\n\n                              The organization\n\nThe national Nurse-Family Partnership organization does not  primarily  fund\nthe partner sites on the ground; it does have a  line  item  for  grants  to\nthese organizations, but the amount is very  small  ($24,000  projected  for\n2008).  Instead, it focuses on  technical  assistance.   Partners  apply  to\nNFP, and in exchange for submitting detailed reports and committing to  hold\nto the model, they get the NFP name;  assistance  with  applying  for  local\nfunding (including from the  state);  and  training  for  their  nurses  and\nsupervisors.    The    national    organization’s    main    expenses    are\nevaluation/reporting/management and education;  it  also  conducts  advocacy\nand fundraising.\n\n\nThe organization has extremely thorough data collection.  It has  data  from\neach partner on demographics; attrition; implementation (number and  content\nof  visits);  and  a  broad  range  of  outcomes  (maternal  smoking/alcohol\nconsumption, life situation, children’s test scores, etc.)  It  provided  us\nwith a sample report containing all of this data, and  national  aggregates;\nit was not able to provide  us  site-by-site  data  due  to  confidentiality\nissues.\n\nThis organization stands out from any other we have examined, in any  cause,\nfor its clarity of strategy, commitment to replicating what is  proven,  and\nability  to  continue  learning  about  what  works  (both  through  ongoing\nrandomized trials and through the data collected from all its sites).\n\n                          Head Start-style programs\n\n                                  The model\n\nHead Start is a federally funded program providing 3-4 hours a  day  of  day\ncare to 4-5 year old children of families below the poverty line (90%  of  a\nprogram’s participants  must  be  below  the  poverty  line).   It  includes\neducational programming, nutrition and health  services,  and  often  has  a\nparental component as well (counseling, social services, home visits).\n\nUniversal Pre-K is a New York program that  provides  additional  funds  and\nadditional oversight, and  generally  involves  extending  child  care  from\npartial to full days.\n\n                          Evidence of effectiveness\n\nHead Start is a politically charged program, and  there  has  been  a  great\ndeal of study on it.  We  have  examined  several  individual  studies,  but\nlearned most of what we know from a literature review by W.S.  Barnett  that\nsystematically  collects  the   studies   meeting   certain   methodological\ncriteria.\n\nThe most often cited  evidence  for  preschool’s  effectiveness  comes  from\n“model programs,” which are generally privately  funded  and  evaluated  and\nhave extremely high quality and intensity (much higher than a  typical  Head\nStart program’s).  Out of the 15 studies of  such  programs,  9  showed  the\ntreatment group as statistically significantly better off, as of  3rd  grade\nor later, by at least one of the  following  measures:  IQ  (rare),  special\neducation and grade retention, achievement  test  scores  and  statistically\nequivalent on the others; 5 didn’t  show  strong  effects  one  way  or  the\nother; in one, the treatment group  had  lower  IQ.   About  half  of  these\nemployed experimental design (i.e., used randomization).  The  studies  that\nwere methodologically strongest, and most careful in their selection of  at-\nrisk children, showed the most impressive effects.\n\nThere are also  24  studies  that  compared  participants  in  ongoing  (and\nprobably more typical) preschool programs to  a  comparison  group,  usually\nchildren with similar demographics who had not attended preschool  (most  of\nthese studies were looking  specifically  at  Head  Start  programs).   None\nemployed experimental design. 22 of the 24  do  not  control  for  selection\nbias, i.e., possible attitudinal differences between families who choose  to\nparticipate or not participate in  Head  Start.  The  other  two  made  some\nattempt to correct for this, but also suffered from high  attrition.  15  of\nthe 24 studies (including 1 of  the  2  that  seems  to  have  attempted  to\ncontrol for selection bias) showed Head Start children with a  statistically\nsignificant advantage as of grade 3 or later (and in the last  year  of  the\nstudy) on at least  one  of:  high  school  graduation,  achievement  tests,\nspecial education, grade retention.  9  showed  mixed  or  non-statistically\nsignificant effects.\n\nNote that there is a great deal of  politically  charged  debate  over  Head\nStart, and the program is commonly claimed to have “no effects” or  “effects\nthat fade out over time.”  From what we’ve seen,  we  agree  with  Barnett’s\nconclusion that debates over Head Start too often  focuses  narrowly  on  IQ\neffects (which generally do “fade out” entirely); when looking  broadly  for\nevidence of improved mental health  and  acuity,  we  believe  the  evidence\npoints to an effect of some size.\n\nWe would bet that  Head  Start  is  having  a  lasting  positive  effect  on\npeople’s lives.  It is difficult to  think  about  whether  this  effect  is\n“more or less significant” than that  of  nurse  visits  (discussed  above);\nwe’re dealing with a much greater  number  of  studies,  more  concern  over\nselection  bias,  more  concern  over  publication  bias,  fewer   different\nvariables measured (making  it  easier  for  NFP  to  find  some  apparently\nsignificant effects), fundamentally different variables  measured,  etc.  As\nwe  explain  below,  other  considerations  sway  us  towards  Nurse  Family\nPartnership.\n\n                                    Costs\n\nWe looked at budgets of the day care  programs  that  we  would  potentially\ngrant. They spent $10,000-12,000 per child served per year.  Most  of  these\nfunds come from the government. According to  the  government  agency  which\nadministers the Head Start  program,  New  York  State  Head  Start  Centers\nreceived $8,800 per child enrolled, per year.\n\nMany of the studies on Head Start’s effectiveness looked  at  programs  that\nlasted more than one year.  The 24 studies of “typical”  preschool  programs\ndid not clearly show more  impressive  effects  for  longer  programs;  when\nlooking through the more methodologically rigorous “model program”  studies,\none-year programs appear weaker (of 6 studies on one-year programs,  only  2\nshowed a statistically significant impact in  at  least  one  of  the  major\nmeasured areas, and the only one of these 2 that  used  experimental  design\nwas the study of the Perry Preschool  program,  which  was  unusually  well-\nfunded  and  unusually  careful  in   selecting   low-intelligence/high-risk\nparticipants).\n\n                                Organizations\n\nWe have very little understanding of the organizations we have  examined  in\nthis area, other than their status as  Head  Start  and/or  Universal  Pre-K\nprograms.  We have no way to confirm their likely effect  on  life  outcomes\nfor children: a few provided test score data for their children, but  in  no\ncase were  we  able  to  get  any  sense  of  the  counterfactual  (i.e.,  a\ncomparison to “normal” progress on these sorts  of  tests).   Many  provided\nextremely detailed descriptions of their activities, but in no case were  we\nable to find an association between  activities  or  program  qualities  and\ndocumented effectiveness.  Most are relatively small organizations,  and  we\nhave little sense for how additional funding would affect them.\n\nWe would find  it  reasonable  to  split  the  Cause  3  grant  between  all\napplicants that are certified Head Start  programs  and/or  Universal  Pre-K\nprograms – betting on  the  effectiveness  of  that  basic  model,  and  the\ngovernment’s ability to monitor it, much as a grant to an NFP  partner  site\nwould be betting on the NFP model and the central organization’s ability  to\nmonitor it.  However, we do not feel that  we  have  enough  information  to\nmake a reasonable decision between one preschool program and another.\n\n                               Recommendation\n\nWe are fairly confident that funding either  the  Nurse  Family  Partnership\nmodel or the Head Start model would improve people’s lives.\n\nWe recommend awarding the grant to Nurse Family  Partnership,  because:  (a)\nwe have more confidence that the grant will be used  to  “do  more  of  what\nworks” – we have very little sense of how our preschool applicants would  be\naffected by more funds;  (b)  we  find  the  organization  to  be  extremely\nimpressive and in line with our principles, and feel that  funding  it  will\nbe putting money in the  hands  of  people  who  are  willing  and  able  to\ncontinue adding to our knowledge of what works.\n"

KIPP is a network of 50+ schools across  the  country.  The  basic  model\n   works as follows: the KIPP Foundation is responsible for  recruiting  and\n   training principals, negotiating with the state to start up schools,  and\n   providing additional assistance in starting up schools.  KIPP NYC is  the\n   New  York  network  of  KIPP  schools  and  is  responsible  for  raising\n   supplemental private funds for its schools (as required by the state), as\n   well as other programs aiming to  help  KIPP  students  get  as  good  an\n   education possible before and after attending KIPP.\n\n The essentials of KIPP’s value added as we understand them are:\n\n    • KIPP's founders personally work to find great principals and give them\n      support (a Shared Services team that  does  administrative  work)  and\n      autonomy.\n    •  The  principals  are  generally   highly   concerned   with   teacher\n      recruitment.\n    • Schools generally have extended hours.\n\nThe model makes sense to us, and the empirical evidence is  consistent  with\nthe idea that it is working. Two  quasi-experimental  studies  and  our  own\nanalysis of all publicly available test data give us  some  confidence  that\nKIPP causes a significant “KIPP Impact” on students’ test scores.\n\nKIPP  has  scaled  effectively  over  the  past  five  years  (adding   5-10\nschools/year between 2002 and 2007). We estimate that  KIPP  spends  $5,000-\n10,000 per student (excluding per-pupil funding KIPP receives  as  a  public\nschool replacement, which accounts for an additional $11,000 per student).\n\n2. Teach for America recruits, trains and places  recent  college  graduates\nin  low-income  public  schools  across  the  country.  It’s  important   to\nacknowledge the broad potential benefits of  this  model,  which  explicitly\naims to increase talented people’s interested in  education.  (For  example,\nKIPP’s  two  founders  and  almost  all  teachers  and  principals  are  TFA\ngraduates.) We have confidence that TFA is  reliably  adding  decent-to-good\nteachers (as good as, or a little better than, other teachers) to the  pool.\n TFA has increased the number of corps from 2,100 to 2,700 between 2005  and\n2007 and plans to reach 4,100 corps members by 2010.   TFA  spends  $15,000-\n20,000 per teacher placed.\n\n3. Children’s  Scholarship  Fund  provides  privately  subsidized  vouchers,\nallowing children with low incomes to attend private schools.  The  rigorous\nstudies on this  approach  imply  no  statistically  significant  effect  on\nacademic  performance  (measured  by  standardized  test  scores)  for   the\npopulation as a whole, and a possible effect for African-American  students.\nIt's relatively easy for us to see how  this  model  could  be  inferior  to\nKIPP’s in terms of improving disadvantaged children's education, since  it’s\npossible that  those  who  benefit  are  primarily  highly  active/motivated\nfamilies who are proactively looking to  send  their  kid  to  a  particular\nschool and ready to pay for it, and would likely send their kid  to  private\nschool with or without a scholarship. (We are not clear on how CSF sets  its\nscholarship size, and  how  well  it  is  avoiding  the  problem  of  giving\nfamilies  more  than  they  need  to  afford  tuition.)   The  schools   CSF\nrecipients attend have  an  average  tuition  of  $3,000/year  and  CSF,  on\naverage, provides $1,500 requiring families to pay  the  other  half.   We’d\nguess that the schools CSF students attend spend another  $5,000-10,000  per\npupil that they raise through their own fundraising efforts.\n\nAchievement First and Replications Inc. are similar to  KIPP  in  that  they\ncreate new schools.  We prefer  KIPP  to  Achievement  First  (which  hasn’t\ndemonstrated  an  ability  to  scale  across  many  schools  and  has  scant\navailable test  score  data)  and  Replications  (which  didn’t  demonstrate\nimproved test scores for its students).\n\nNone  of  our  other  applicants  demonstrated  any  effect  on  educational\noutcomes in a way that  made  what  we  consider  a  reasonable  attempt  to\ncontrol for selection bias (or produced  evidence  strong  enough  to  imply\nthat it is generated by more than selection bias).\n\n                                    KIPP\n\n                          Evidence of Effectiveness\n\nWe read two quasi-experimental studies of KIPP (each  covering  one  school)\nand gathered and analyzed all publicly available test score data.  Both  the\npapers and our own analysis our consistent with the  proposition  that  KIPP\nhas a significant impact on the test scores of its students.\n\nI. Quasi-experimental studies\n\nA. KIPP Diamond Academy: compared the scores  of  5th  and  6th  grade  KIPP\nstudents to a matched comparison group (matched on previous test scores  and\nother demographic  factors)  and  found  that  KIPP  students  significantly\noutperformed their controls and the one cohort for which we have  two  years\nof data significantly improved (both outright and relative to the  controls)\nbetween 5th and 6th grades. Note that  this  study  matched  students  on  a\nstudent-by- student basis so phenomena like selective attrition  are  not  a\nconcern.\n\nB. KIPP Ujima: studied the four cohorts that entered 5th grade from  2002-05\nover the course of  their  careers  at  KIPP.  The  researches  divided  all\nstudents into four groups: (a) those that advanced  with  their  class,  (b)\nthose that were retained, (c) those that left KIPP entirely, and  (d)  those\nthat arrived at KIPP in 6th grade or later. Isolating  those  students  that\nstayed at KIPP  from  those  that  left,  were  retained,  or  arrived,  the\nresearchers  found  significant  improvements  in  test  scores   for   KIPP\nstudents.\n\nII. Analysis of all publicly available test score data\n\nA.  The  data  we  gathered.  We  collected  all  available   data,   giving\ninformation on 23 of 57 existing KIPP schools (covering 8 of the  18  states\nin which KIPP has schools). Some data was unavailable because,  among  other\nreasons, some states don’t publish test data on the internet or  don’t  test\nthe grades covered by KIPP schools, or  the  schools  are  so  new  that  no\nscores are available yet.\n\nB. Results. We found that students enrolled in  KIPP  schools  significantly\nimproved their test scores relative to students at neighboring  schools.  We\nsegmented the data we collected into three groups. (a) Group 1: cohorts  for\nwhich we only have 5th and 6th grade date; (b) Group 2:  cohorts  for  which\nwe have 5th-7th grade data; and (c) Group 3: cohorts for which we have  5th-\n8th grade data.\n\nThe table below  shows  the  average  %  passing  for  KIPP  cohorts,  their\ncomparison groups, and KIPP students’ scores relative to  district  schools.\n(The scores we have start at 5th grade and likely include  some  portion  of\nKIPP’s impact on 5th grade scores; we don’t know the  exact  date  when  the\ntests are given.)\n\n\n      [pic]\n\nKIPP students significantly improve relative to  the  district  between  5th\nand 6th grade and maintain those gains throughout middle school.\n\n\n           [pic]\n\nC.  Results  accounting  for  attrition/addition.  KIPP  schools  experience\nsignificant student turnover – existing students who leave and new  students\nwho arrive. Because our analysis looks at  class  aggregate  scores,  it  is\npossible that the perceived improvement in scores is really due to a  change\nin class composition:  poorer-performing  students  may  leave  and  higher-\nperforming students  may  arrive,  which  would  create  the  appearance  of\nimproving test scores regardless of KIPP’s actual impact.\n\nWe have limited information about (a) the number of students who arrive  and\nthose who leave and (b) test performance of those who advance from  year  to\nyear, those who leave, and those who arrive.  The  information  we  do  have\ncomes from three papers: (a) the KIPP Ujima paper mentioned  above,  (b)  an\nunpublished paper by a Harvard Graduate School of Education student on  KIPP\nGaston College Preparatory in North  Carolina,  and  (c)  the  KIPP  Diamond\nAcademy study mentioned above. All three papers provide data on  the  number\nof students who leave; KIPP Ujima paper shows the performance of  those  who\nleave and those who arrive, and the  KIPP  Diamond  Academy  paper  provides\nperformance data only for those who arrive.\n\nFrom those sources we take away the following facts:\n\n    • 10%-25% of students who enroll at KIPP  do  not  progress  with  their\n      class from 5th  to  6th  grade  (either  because  they  leave  or  are\n      retained). Students also leave following 6th and  7th  grades,  though\n      far fewer do so.\n    • Students who leave KIPP score significantly worse than those who stay,\n      scoring roughly equivalent to students at district schools.\n    • Students who arrive at KIPP score significantly  better  than  average\n      students at district schools, but not  as  high  as  students  already\n      enrolled at KIPP. (One exception: the KIPP Diamond Academy study looks\n      at 17 students who entered in 6th grade, and finds that they performed\n      better than existing KIPP students on reading but worse on math.)\n\nTo assess the impact of student attrition and  addition,  we  estimated  the\nimprovement  of  KIPP  students  from  5th  to   6th   grade   (where   most\nattrition/addition  occurs)  assuming  varying  amounts   of   (a)   student\nattrition, (b) performance of those who left, and (c) performance  of  those\nwho arrived.  We found that it would take relatively high estimates  of  the\namount of attrition and difference  in  quality  to  account  for  the  KIPP\neffect, and therefore, we don’t think churn explains the entire impact.\n\n    • At low levels of attrition (0-10%), there is no  case  (i.e.,  failure\n      rate of those who leave or passing  rate  of  those  who  enter)  that\n      explains the KIPP effect.\n    • At 20% attrition levels, the KIPP impact is wiped out when  we  assume\n      that: 1) all of those who leave were failing  and  all  of  those  who\n      entered were average for the local public  district;  or  2)  entering\n      students are at the new KIPP level and  those  who  leave  are  50-70%\n      worse than the public district average.\n    • At 30% attrition, the KIPP impact is wiped out when we assume that: 1)\n      students who leave are 80% worse than the district  and  enterers  are\n      average relative to the public district; or 2) entering students enter\n      at KIPP students' average performance levels and those who  leave  are\n      20-40% worse than the public district average.\n    • At very high levels of attrition (40-50%),  churn  is  a  more  likely\n      (though we still think not that likely) cause of the KIPP effect: even\n      at 50% churn, the KIPP effect is only explained away  when  we  assume\n      that: 1) all leaving students were at the public district  level,  and\n      all entering students were already on par with KIPP  students;  or  2)\n      all entering students were 25% better than the public district average\n      and all leaving students were 25% worse.\n\nIII. Other research\n\nKIPP also provided us with six studies that have significant  methodological\nproblems (e.g., they don’t deal with student attrition; they  don’t  have  a\nreasonable comparison group). All imply effects consistent with the  results\nabove.\n\n                                    Cost\n\nKIPP schools receives funds from several sources: (a) per-pupil funding for\neach student enrolled, (b) state and federal grants mandated to support new\nschools, (c) support from the KIPP Foundation, and (d) private donations\nfrom corporations, foundations, and individuals. We have detailed budget\ninformation for the four KIPP schools in New York City and used that data\nto estimate KIPP’s cost per student.\n\n           [pic]\n\n\n\n                              Teach for America\n\n                          Evidence of Effectiveness\n\nWe reviewed the two experimental/quasi-experimental  studies  that  evaluate\nTFA teachers' impact on their students' scores on state  mandated  math  and\nreading exams. We are convinced by the  results  of  the  Mathematica  study\n(which found TFA teachers have a small  but  statistically  impact  on  math\nscores and no impact on reading scores) because  of  its  breadth  (covering\nschools  across  the  country)   and   methodological   rigor   (randomized,\ncontrolled design), and we question the results of the Arizona study  (which\nfound that TFA teachers negatively impact their  students'  scores)  because\nits design is open to highly plausible alternative explanations.\n\nA. Mathematica  study:  compared  test  scores  of  1st-5th  grade  students\nrandomly assigned amongst TFA and non-TFA classrooms in the same grades  and\nsame schools. The study found that students in classes taught by  TFA  corps\nmembers  showed  greater  increases  in  math   standardized   test   scores\npercentile rank over the course of instruction  year  than  their  peers  in\nclasses taught by non-TFA teachers in the  same  schools.   On  the  reading\nexam, students in TFA classes showed the same results.  The study  evaluated\n100 teachers' classes and was distributed over 6 of TFA’s  urban  and  rural\nprogram regions.\n\nB. Arizona State study: compared  the  performance  of  students  taught  by\nregularly  certified  and  under-certified  teachers  (including  TFA  corps\nmembers),  and  found  that  students  of  TFA   corps   members   performed\ncommensurate with other under-certified teachers and  worse  then  regularly\ncertified teachers.  Unlike  the  Mathematica  study,  this  study  compared\nlevels of performance (as opposed to changes in  performance)  and  did  not\nmatch teachers on their students’ test scores from previous  years,  leaving\nopen the possibility  that  certain  teachers  received  classes  that  were\nalready performing at  levels  significantly  higher  or  lower  than  those\nreceived by the teachers with whom they were compared.\n\n                        Impact of increased donations\n\nTFA’s New York area-Executive  Director  said  that  TFA-New  York  was  not\nplanning to increase its number of teachers. She said  that  the  number  of\nteachers needed is a function of the public school system’s needs, and  they\ndon’t need more teachers at the moment.\n\nAccording to TFA’s website, the number of corps members increased from  2100\nto 2400 between 2005 and 2006 with plans to increase the number to  4200  by\n2010. (According to its 2006 IRS Form 990, TFA had 2900  corps  members  for\n2007.)\n\nCost\nWe have two sources for TFA costs: (a) the latest IRS Form 990 available  on\nGuidestar (2004) and (b) the New York  City  budget  sent  as  part  of  its\napplication.\n\n   A. In 2004,  according  to  its  990,  TFA  spent  $40  million  and  had\n      approximately 2,000 corps members.\n   B. In 2007, TFA spent $15 million in New York (including New York’s share\n      of national overhead) and had 1,000 corps members.\n\n                         Children’s Scholarship Fund\n\n                          Evidence of Effectiveness\n\nThe academic debate on the effectiveness of school vouchers largely  focuses\non an experiment conducted in New York City.   Students  interested  in  the\nvoucher  program  applied  to  a  lottery  and  researchers   examined   the\nsubsequent standardized test performance  of  those  who  received  vouchers\nrelative to those who did not.\n\nThe academics studying this issue differ on  the  results.  All  agree  that\nthere is no evidence for a significant impact of  vouchers  on  test  scores\nfor the population as a whole.\n\n    • Harvard  University  researchers  found  a  statistically  significant\n      impact on the academic performance of African-American students.\n    • Princeton University researchers argue that  the  impact  on  African-\n      Americans depends heavily on the classification of students  from  the\n      Dominican Republic and that reclassifying those students’ race  erases\n      the statistically significant impact.\n    • Mathematica researchers initially agreed with the Harvard researchers’\n      conclusions about impact, but changed their position after considering\n      the Princeton researchers’ arguments, concluding that “one must remain\n      cautious when interpreting the findings for African-Americans.”\n\nWhile the logic of the voucher model is strong, we are  not  convinced  that\nvouchers significantly improve the education of the  students  that  receive\nthem.\n\nOther  research  papers  we’ve  looked  at  studying  vouchers   contain   a\nsystematic bias between the  treatment  and  control  group  –  the  studies\ninclude those who receive vouchers and choose not to attend private  schools\nin the control – and we therefore have not detailed them here. The  findings\nof those studies are consistent with the results above (i.e., no  effect  on\nthe population as a whole;  statistically  significant  impact  on  African-\nAmericans).\n\n                                    Cost\n\nCSF spends approximately $30  million  to  provide  scholarships  to  25,000\nchildren. Average  tuition  at  a  school  attended  by  a  CSF  scholarship\nrecipient is $3,000.\n\nThe parochial schools which CSF  students  attend  also  conduct  their  own\nfundraising.  We don’t have expenses for the schools in which  CSF  students\nenroll (these schools are religious institutions and  are  not  required  to\nfile their financials publicly), but we do for  one  of  our  applicants,  a\nparochial school in New York City applied to  us  for  a  grant.  They  have\ntotal expenses  of  $3.5  million  and  serve  approximately  300  students,\nspending $12,000/student.\n"

We  should  also\n      consider the potential of broad, “top-down” research that  focuses  on\n      identifying good times, places, and ways to help people rather than on\n      evaluating particular organizations.\n    • Another major goal for the coming year will be to recruit people  both\n      for our Board of Directors and cause-specific Advisory Boards.\n    • We plan to create a detailed review of our first year and plan for our\n      next year for review at our next Board meeting.\n\n                            Broad Goals for 2008\n\n1. Development: increase the “money moved” by GiveWell (and be on a path  to\nincreasing it further).  “Money moved” can consist  of  direct  grants  from\nthe Clear Fund to charities, or of individual donations that  are  given  to\nour recommended charities with strong  influence  from  our  recommendations\n(or the combination).\n\nHaving produced quality research and attracted attention, we believe we  are\nnow in position to reach more donors, and that our position is not going  to\nimprove significantly from doing more research.  We think  the  question  of\nhow much money GiveWell can move is the most important  unanswered  question\nabout the project.\n\n2. Research: improve significantly on our understanding of the best ways  to\nhelp people.  The most pressing challenge here is setting our  scope  (i.e.,\nwhich causes we research) in a way that accounts for  what  we  learned  the\nfirst time around and puts us in position to allocate our money as  well  as\npossible.\n\n3. Administration: build a mature  organization  with  a  strong  Board  and\nstructure.\n\n                                 Development\n\n                                 The product\n\nOne way or another, we eventually need to “move”  enough  money  to  justify\nour overhead, or establish that we can’t do so and shut  the  project  down.\nHowever,  while  we  need  to  give  grants  in  order  to  get  access   to\ninformation, there’s a grant size past which more money  is  probably  doing\nlittle for our access to information, and at that point the  question  comes\nup of why donors should give to us rather  than  just  using  our  research.\nInsisting on the “United Way / Robin Hood model” of  pooling  donations  and\ngiving grants has a cost for the donor – ceding the choice of charity to  us\n– that doesn’t seem essential to what we’re offering.\n\nIn order to increase our “money moved” in an active,  measurable  way  while\nleaving donors with as much choice as is feasible,  we  propose  to  solicit\ndonors for  commitments  to  donate  to  our  recommended  charities  (their\nchoice), rather than for direct donations  to  GiveWell.   Such  commitments\nshould be as formal and binding as is practical;  we  may  either  become  a\ndonor advised  fund  or  partner  with  one,  so  that  committed  money  is\nliterally put into an account subject to certain rules.\n\nSetting this up would leave us with three possible “offerings” for a donor:\n\n   1. Donate directly to GiveWell, with the aim of helping us  pay  for  our\n      research activities.\n   2. Donate directly  to  GiveWell  with  the  aim  of  having  your  money\n      “managed,” i.e., cede the choice of specific charity to us.\n   3. Put money in a special account, with a  commitment  to  donate  it  to\n      recommended charities if and when we produce recommendations  in  your\n      field of interest.\n\nWe  propose  to  focus  our  fundraising  on  #3,   raise   #1   only   with\nmajor/institutional donors and  core  supporters,  and  de-emphasize  #2  at\nleast for the time being.\n\nAnother important question about our product is what causes we are going  to\nbe focusing on.  This is discussed under “Research” below.\n\n                                  The plan\n\nOnce we’ve settled our product, we need to actively find  potential  donors.\nThis may include:\n\n   1. Contacting the ~1,000 people who have given us permission  to  contact\n      them  when  submitting  surveys  on  our  website,  focusing  on   the\n      particularly high-potential ones we’ve been discussing in our biweekly\n      reports.\n   2. Explicitly targeting particular industries and  companies  to  present\n      at.\n   3. Arranging fundraising events with the aim of getting existing GiveWell\n      contacts to bring friends.\n\nThough our existing staff can pursue these approaches, we feel  there  is  a\nstrong case for conducting an active search –  and  offering  a  competitive\nsalary – for an experienced, talented Development Director.\n\n    •   Unlike   the   work   we’ve    been    focusing    on    to    date,\n      development/fundraising is  an  established  and  largely  generalized\n      discipline, and there is a lot of public discussion and study of  what\n      works.\n    • We have no experience with development,  and  we  don’t  consider  the\n      associated skills to be among current staff’s strengths.\n    • In particular, we have little to no sense of  how  to  set  reasonable\n      expectations for our project in this area.  One way or another, having\n      an experienced fundraiser become intimately familiar with our  project\n      and position seems necessary for setting reasonable expectations.\n    • A good Development Director would be able to set  a  long-term  growth\n      plan and execute on it, as well as take a  major  role  in  GiveWell’s\n      public  communications.   S/he  would  thereby  address  most  of  the\n      weaknesses and non-strengths of current staff, and potentially take or\n      share the Executive Director role.\n    • Unlike evaluating potential  program  staff,  evaluating  a  potential\n      Development Director seems relatively straightforward.\n    • Although such a person would likely command a high salary, it would be\n      relatively easy to continually assess whether the investment is  worth\n      it.  We may try to secure an institutional  grant  for  this  expense,\n      since institutional funders  are  likely  to  be  more  interested  in\n      helping us expand than in using our research for their own grants.\n\n                                  Research\n\nThis section focuses on setting our scope (which causes we’re. covering).\n\nIn choosing our causes, we are going to seek to do  one  broad  cause  at  a\ntime (unless there is enough demand for more to justify hiring more  staff),\nand take donor preferences heavily into account – i.e.,  in  the  course  of\nraising money, we are going to ask  donors  to  specify  which  causes  they\nwould donate for, and leave the  option  open  of  switching  our  plans  to\naccommodate more donors.\n\nAt this point, the cause we feel is the  best  fit  for  the  next  year  is\ndeveloping-world  direct  aid,  including  health,  microfinance  and  other\neconomic assistance, education, and  abandoned  children.   Developing-world\naid was more popular than developed-world aid in our online survey,  and  we\nfeel that we have a very concrete sense of what to investigate  and  how  to\nadd value in these areas.\n\nWe’d also like to note two other potential  causes  that  would  expand  our\nscope well beyond the sort of work we’ve been doing so far:\n\n1. Global warming and (possibly) other catastrophe aversion.   Environmental\nissues, particularly global warming, were extremely popular  in  our  online\nsurvey.  We are generally unfamiliar with these  issues,  and  have  only  a\nmoderate sense for what to investigate and  how  to  add  value.   Comparing\ndifferent “global catastrophe” issues has some potential advantages: we  see\na clearer path to value-added in  listing  and  comparing  options  than  in\ncommitting ourselves to looking  deeply  into  global  warming  issues,  and\ndoing so would increase our appeal to a particular  group  of  intellectuals\nthat we would like to see engaging more with GiveWell.\n\n2. Extremely broad analysis of donors’ options – publishing, side  by  side,\nvery basic analysis of many  options  rather  than  thorough,  organization-\nlevel analysis of a  few.   For  example,  publishing  a  thorough  list  of\ndiseases, symptoms, global burdens, and money spent  per  year  on  research\ncould be a valuable source of information to donors  even  if  it  does  not\ncompare charities side-by-side.\n\nNote that:\n\n    • All of these causes are far broader than the causes we  researched  in\n      our startup year.  This change is based largely on our frustration the\n      first time around with having to give one grant per cause, rather than\n      allocate more money to the causes  we  preferred  (i.e.,  causes  with\n      stronger organizations and more “bang for  your  buck”).   We  believe\n      that trying to narrow causes to the  point  where  we  can  make  true\n      “apples to apples” comparisons is likely futile  and  not  worthwhile;\n      instead, we want to be able to review many different sorts of options,\n      let donors decide what appeals to them most, and  allocate  any  grant\n      money of our own to what appeals to us most.\n\n    • For all three of the causes above, it is possible that we would take a\n      much more “top-down” approach to research than we did  for  our  first\n      year.  Rather than starting with a grant application and  getting  our\n      understanding of different approaches  from  our  applicants,  we  may\n      start  with  independent  research,  looking  for  publicly  published\n      evidence of what works, and then specifically  target  (and  evaluate)\n      organizations whose activities match what we find.\n\n                               Administration\n\n    • We believe it is important to find more  Board  members  who  can  add\n      experience and different perspectives to our  project.   Staff  has  a\n      list of potential Board  members  available;  we  have  discussed  the\n      possibility with some, and not yet with others.\n    • We would also like to form Advisory Boards, separate from our Board of\n      Directors, whose role is to advise  on  recommendations  for  specific\n      causes (i.e., each cause will have its own Advisory Board).\n    • Other goals under this heading include:\n         o Formalizing our metrics and setting clear and public  goals  for\n           GiveWell.\n         o Formalizing our policies, procedures, and roles for  both  Board\n           and staff.\n         o Writing up a thorough look back at our first year,  including  a\n           thorough analysis of our survey data and more generally of  what\n           went well, what went poorly, and what we’ve learned.\n"

We\nbelieve that its model is compelling and supported by empirical evidence on\nstudent achievement.  We also believe it would be reasonable to award Teach\nfor America, whose focus on bringing more talented people into education\nhas had an acknowledged impact on KIPP among other organizations, or the\nChildren’s Scholarship Fund, which gives financial assistance to low-income\nfamilies seeking to send their children to private school (a model we think\nis logically compelling, though not well-supported by available empirical\nevidence).\n\n3.

          "text": "\nReview of startup year\n\n\n      Goals were:\n   1. Do quality research\n   2. Create a quality product\n   3. Draw attention to the product and the ideas behind it\n   4. Begin to build toward a mature/self-sustaining organization\n\n\n      1. Research: questions were whether we could get charities to\n      participate, whether the ensuing information set would allow us to add\n      value, how long our recommendations take to produce, and how valuable\n      they are.\n\n\n           Could we get charities to participate?  Yes; insert #’s on\n           charities contacted, applied, etc. along with data about $25k\n           vs. $100k.\n\n\n           Did the ensuing information set allow us to add value?\n           Certainly we got a lot further than we could before.  In all\n           cases, we got the ability to answer the “What do you do”\n           question with a concreteness that we couldn’t using the info on\n           the website.  However, on actual outcomes data, it was somewhat\n           rare that we got anything through our grant app that we couldn’t\n           get without it.  Note that our outcomes data for KIPP, NFP, and\n           HOPE was all publicly available, although PSI (and many strong\n           non-winners such as Year Up, St. Nick’s, Interplast) provided us\n           with outcomes data that wasn’t publicly available.  In the case\n           of most specific charities, though, we believe that we can’t get\n           the outcomes data because it doesn’t exist.\n\n\n           How long did our recommendations take to produce?  Round 1 was\n           quick, only about 4 weeks to both choose and write up apps for\n           finalists.  Round 2 was much slower.  It basically took us Aug\n           through March (8 months) for 5 causes; there were many\n           distractions in there, including practically no work done\n           between Dec. 20 and Jan. 20, but we also worked 2 months at an\n           unsustainable rate (110 hrs per person per week).  All in all,\n           it seems somewhat fair to say that causes, at the size and\n           method we do them now, take about 2 mo each.  We initially\n           underestimated the time commitment and were thus unable to make\n           good on our formal obligations to applicants.\n\n\n           How valuable are our recommendations?  This question is somewhat\n           unanswerable since we generally only got information from our\n           strongest applicants.  Here are a few observations though: (1)\n           in Cause 1 it seems clear that radically difft approaches can\n           have radically difft costs, and there is a real divergence\n           between proven/simple (bednets, condoms, hospitals) and unproven\n           (health ed) approaches.  We think we added a lot of value here.\n           (2) In Cause 2 we think we added practically nothing – shocked\n           at how little info there is on this cause.  (3) In Cause 3 we\n           found one great charity that is doing something proven; no one\n           else seems to be doing anything proven.  This seems really\n           important for early child care.  (4) In Cause 4 we think that\n           most methods are not effective at all and we found a method that\n           we would bet is effective.  (5) In Cause 5 it seems clear that\n           there are big differences in effectiveness, because the\n           approaches & populations are so different, but we aren’t sure we\n           actually found the right one.  (6) We also feel we learned a ton\n           about the across-cause comparison – we probably added more value\n           across than within causes.  Knowing that Cause 5 programs cost\n           about $20k to $25k per enrollee for programs that may not be\n           helping anyone, while health programs can save a life for $1-5k,\n           seems huge.\n\n\n           We feel our causes were too narrow, putting us in a position of\n           knowingly allocating our funds sub-optimally while still not\n           being narrow enough to allow us to do true “apples to apples”\n           comparisons (a goal we now believe is entirely futile).\n\n\n      2. Create a product: website was created for ~$5k.  We judge the\n      quality according to the response from the 50,000 hits we got in\n      December.\n    • X% bounce rate, Y avg time on site; X1%/Y1 for Adwords, X2%/Y2 for NYT\n      readers.  Benchmark to what’s considered “good.”\n    • X surveys, Y giving us permission to contact them – an “action rate”\n      of Z%.  Benchmark to what’s considered “good.”\n    • The following feedback from surveys: [insert users’ evaluations of our\n      quality]\n    • X donations, totaling $Y, to our recommended charities.  Again, try to\n      find benchmarks of some kind.\n\n\n      3. Draw attention to the product: this was a decidedly mixed bag.  The\n      good:\n         • Sector buzz – not only did we get on the cover of the Chronicle,\n           but we have seen people discussing our issues far more than they\n           were when we got started.  In particular, the need for resources\n           that go beyond Charity Navigator – has been discussed on blogs,\n           raised by Hewlett, and well covered in that WSJ article.\n         • General attention – the best exposure we got was from the NYT\n           article, which focused on our personalities as much as our\n           product, and got a considerable amount of attention [insert\n           stats - #3 most emailed, web traffic, etc.]\n      The bad:\n         • Astroturfing fiasco – poor judgment on staff’s part led to\n           negative exposure, bridges burned with a particular online\n           community as well as questions from the nonprofit sector.\n         • Lots of people just hate us, due to a combination of things we\n           can control (tone) and things we can’t (we’re young,\n           inexperienced, have for-profit backgrounds, etc.)\n\n      Our personalities have been both assets and liabilities – they’ve\n      gotten us a lot of good attention and gotten us into trouble.  For\n      now, we’re toning them down.\n\n\n     4. Begin to build toward a mature/self-sustaining organization.  We\n        accomplished:\n            • Incorporation, 501c3 status, establishment of bylaws and\n              accounting procedures, construction of Board of Directors.\n            • A greatly expanded set of contacts.\n\n      We fell short when it came to:\n         • Establishing clear roles and expectations for the Board, as well\n           as metrics for ourselves.\n         • The astroturfing incidents have potentially hurt our standing in\n           the sector and ability to partner with others.\n\n\nPlans for 2008\n\n\n\nOverview of goals\n\n\nOur most important goals for 2008 are:\n\n   1. Increase the “money moved” by GiveWell, where “money moved” refers to\n      the sum of (a) grants given directly by the Clear Fund and (b)\n      individual donations that are made to recommended charities, primarily\n      on our recommendation.  Our money moved provides an indicator of how\n      much influence our research has and how much donors value it; in the\n      long run, GiveWell will be viable if and only if we are moving a large\n      amount of money relative to our operating costs.  Beginning to\n      increase our money moved is therefore our top priority.\n   2. Perform more quality research on what charities do, whether it works,\n      and how individual donors can accomplish as much good as possible.\n      This research is our core value-added, and continuing to create it is\n      nearly as important as increasing its influence.\n   3. Engage more critical thinkers who will critique, discuss, and help\n      improve our research.\n   4. Continue building our Board of Directors and improving our metrics and\n      governance.\n\n\nGoal 1: Increase the “money moved” by GiveWell\n\nUltimately, GiveWell’s viability and importance depend on how much our\nresearch matters to donors.  Our most important goal for the coming year is\nto expand our influence, either by raising money directly for the Clear\nFund (to be regranted to our top charities) or by getting our research and\nrecommendations to donors who will use them in their giving decisions.  In\norder to accomplish this, we need to determine what “product” we are\noffering donors, and then market it broadly and effectively.\n\nThe product\n\nSince its inception, GiveWell has had many different ways of structuring\nand framing what we offer donors.  It’s important to agree on which ones\nwe’ll be emphasizing.  Below are five different “arrangements” a donor can\nhave with GiveWell (note that these are not mutually exclusive; different\ndonors can have different arrangements).\n\n   1. Funding GiveWell’s operating expenses.  Some donors are interested  in\n      our potential to improve philanthropy  in  general,  but  have  little\n      interest in the specific causes we’re focusing on.   Such  donors  may\n      give  unrestricted  gifts  to  GiveWell,  to  be  used  for   whatever\n      combination of salaries, administrative costs, and grants  best  helps\n      us accomplish our mission.  Speaking  anecdotally,  major  foundations\n      and extremely wealthy individuals tend to  fall  into  this  category,\n      since they have no need of our research (having the capacity  to  fund\n      their own) but are interested in what our research can  do  for  other\n      donors.\n   2. The United Way model.  This is the main structure we have used so far:\n      we ask donors to delegate their giving decisions to us within  certain\n      broad parameters.  For example, a donor can indicate  whether  his/her\n      donation is to be used for the developed or developing world,  health-\n      or income-focused charity, etc., but we make the final choice of which\n      organization receives the grant.  A donor who gives  in  this  way  is\n      funding some combination of our operating expenses  and  grants  (they\n      often have the option to mark their donation specifically for grants),\n      under the basic idea that we can make better use of the funds  overall\n      (within the philosophical guidelines that have been set for  us)  than\n      the donor can.\n   3. The  philanthropic  advisor  model.   We  have  discussed,  but  never\n      implemented, a possible arrangement in which a major donor would  work\n      closely  with  us  –  making  major   decisions   ranging   from   our\n      philosophical agenda (i.e., which cause we research and which criteria\n      we use to narrow down charities) to the final choice of which  charity\n      to grant.  The donor would provide funding\n   4. Using GiveWell’s research without donating to GiveWell.  We attempt to\n      make all  our  reasoning  and  recommendations  public,  so  that  any\n      interested party can use them.  To date,  there  has  been  just  over\n      $35,000 donated to our recommended charities through our  website  but\n      bypassing us entirely (there may also be donors who used our  research\n      as one of many inputs into a decision, but we have no way of  tracking\n      this).\n   5. The GiveWell Pledge Fund.  The GiveWell Pledge Fund will be  a  donor-\n      advised fund, serving donors who wish to  use  –  and  facilitate  the\n      creation of – our research and recommendations,  without  any  further\n      commitment to GiveWell  itself  (i.e.,  without  contributing  to  the\n      funding of our operations or ceding the final choice of  charity).   A\n      donor who contributes to the GiveWell Pledge Fund will retain advisory\n      rights over that donation, and be subject to a Donor Deadline by which\n      the funds  must  be  distributed  to  one  of  GiveWell’s  recommended\n      charities; but the donor will retain  the  right  to  determine  which\n      charity that is.  The aim is to reach donors who would  otherwise  opt\n      for #4 above, thus gaining a more reliable and earlier measure of  our\n      influence; this will both help GiveWell to make plans  and  operations\n      that are appropriate for the size of its  influence,  and  help  Clear\n      Fund applicants to evaluate  the  benefits  of  completing  our  grant\n      application.\n\nAt this stage in our development, we believe that we can best increase our\nmoney moved by focusing on #1 and #5 (#5 when targeting small-to-medium\ndonors and #1 when targeting institutional and other extremely large\ndonors, as well as highly loyal donors).\n\nThis approach has drawbacks:\n    • It will force us to raise money in two entirely separate ways, i.e.,\n      our operating expenses will not scale cleanly and automatically with\n      our “money moved.”  However, we currently have enough unrestricted\n      fund to operate at our current size through 2008; if we draw enough\n      GiveWell Pledges to justify expanding our operations, we believe that\n      we will have a very strong and clear case to make to major funders\n      (i.e., we will be able to show them exactly how much leverage they are\n      getting for their investment in our operations).\n    • By giving donors the choice of where to give, we will sacrifice the\n      benefits of “pooling donations” that public foundations such as United\n      Way and Robin Hood benefit from.  In particular, we will have to\n      continue seeking scalable interventions, which often significantly\n      narrows our options, and will not be able to invest in dedicated\n      projects such as funding evaluations.\n\n\nBut for reasons stated above, we believe our most important goal for 2008\nis to increase our money moved; the costs above are minor relative to the\nbenefits of removing all unnecessary obstacles to a donor’s commitment.  #5\nabove asks as little of a donor as possible while still having him/her\ncontribute to our “money moved” in a concrete, committed, measurable way;\nwe believe that focusing on this offering is therefore our best hope of\nmaximizing our “money moved.”\n\nThe marketing\n\nTo date, we haven’t put much of our energy or resources into marketing.   We\nraised our startup capital from former coworkers, who were  well  positioned\nto evaluate us as people, and we did  not  make  serious  efforts  to  raise\nmoney from “outsiders” (i.e., people who have no  knowledge  of  us  outside\nour work for GiveWell) because we didn’t yet have a  concrete  demonstration\nof our output (i.e., our research reports).\n\nNow that we do have such a demonstration, we can and must expand our donor\nbase.  Below, we’ve listed our preliminary ideas for doing so; however, we\nbelieve that it will be essential to involve experienced development\nprofessionals in this process as much as possible.  We intend to make a\nconcerted effort to hire a full-time Development Director, for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\n    •   Unlike   the   work   we’ve    been    focusing    on    to    date,\n      development/fundraising is  an  established  and  largely  generalized\n      discipline, and there is a lot of public discussion and study of  what\n      works.\n    • We have no experience with development,  and  we  don’t  consider  the\n      associated skills to be among current staff’s strengths.\n    • In particular, we have little to no sense of  how  to  set  reasonable\n      expectations for our project in this area.  One way or another, having\n      an experienced fundraiser become intimately familiar with our  project\n      and position seems necessary for setting reasonable expectations.\n    • A good Development Director would be able to set  a  long-term  growth\n      plan and execute on it, as well as take a  major  role  in  GiveWell’s\n      public  communications.   S/he  would  thereby  address  most  of  the\n      weaknesses and non-strengths of current staff, and potentially take or\n      share the Executive Director role.\n    • Unlike evaluating potential  program  staff,  evaluating  a  potential\n      Development Director seems relatively straightforward.\n    • Although such a person would likely command a high salary, it would be\n      relatively easy to continually assess whether the investment is  worth\n      it.\n\nThat said, it is very likely that we will not be able to find a suitable\nfull-time Development Director – someone who is not only experienced and\nexcellent at their role, but willing and excited to join us in our current,\nstartup form.  We need to be ready to fundraise without this sort of full-\ntime help, even as we look for it.\n\nOur preliminary strategy for fundraising will consist of:\n\n   1. Speaking with all of the potential donors we’ve made contact with\n      about both making GiveWell Pledges (see #5 under “The product” above)\n      and getting us in touch with other potential donors.\n   2. Seeking contacts (both among our existing contacts and among their\n      friends) who can arrange meetings for us at finance and software\n      firms, to introduce GiveWell and ask for GiveWell Pledges.  We\n      anticipate that most initial meetings will be small gatherings of non-\n      major donors, but if we can make contacts who are highly committed to\n      GiveWell, we may eventually be able to reach many people throughout\n      the companies.\n   3. Organizing fundraising events, and attempting to attract potential\n      donors to them as social activities.  Again, we may have to start with\n      small events consisting mostly of young people, but anticipate that\n      with high-quality contacts, we will eventually be able to reach more\n      potential donors.\n\n\nWe plan on making the search for a Development Director our first priority,\nfollowed by the three strategies above (in the order they’re listed).\n\n\nGoal 2: perform more quality research\n\nThough expanding our reach is our primary goal for 2008, it is also\nessential that we make continued progress on the question of how to\naccomplish as much good as possible with charitable donations.  This\nsection will first discuss our basic approach to investigating a given\ncause, and particularly how it will be changing from last year’s; it will\nthen discuss our tentative plan for which types of charities to focus on.\n\nResearch methodology\n\nWe feel that the basic approach we took last year – giving large grants so\nthat we can collect information through our application process – remains\nthe best approach we know of.  It allowed us to collect a large amount of\ninformation from our applicants in a relatively short period of time; we\nknow of no other source for similar information, and no other approach that\nwe feel could have yielded such information within a comparable budget and\ntimeline.\n\nThat said, we are planning on modifying the following aspects of our\napproach:\n\nBreadth of causes.  We constructed our five causes for 2007 (saving lives\nin Africa; fighting poverty in Africa; early childhood care in NYC; K-12\neducation in NYC; employment assistance in NYC) to facilitate “apples to\napples” comparisons between organizations – for example, we had hoped to\ncompare two organizations within the “saving lives in Africa” cause with an\napproximation of the “cost per life saved.”  As detailed above, we feel\nthat this approach left us making overly constrained decisions (for\nexample, awarding one grant each in Cause 1 and Cause 2 when we preferred\ntwo applicants in Cause 1 to any applicant in Cause 2).\n\nIf we give donors more control over which charities ultimately receive\ntheir donations (see “Structure” above), it will no longer be nearly as\nimportant to make “apples to apples” comparisons (something that turned out\nto be infeasible anyway); more important is to examine as many applicants\nas possible that might fit our donors’ philosophical priorities.  As such,\nwe will be aiming to define a “cause” more broadly than last year: rather\nthan grouping charities that can be directly compared (as we largely tried\nto do last year), we will group charities by the donors who are likely to\nbe interested in them.\n\nBased on conversations with donors as well as the survey data we have\navailable (see XX), we believe that our potential supporters have\nrelatively broad interests – for example, most people who are interested in\ndeveloping-world health are also interested in developing-world economic\nempowerment, education, etc.  Based on this, we anticipate defining causes\nmuch more broadly in 2008 than we did in 2007.  Concrete examples of\n“causes” for 2008 are below (see blah).\n\nNumber of causes.  In 2007, we researched five causes at once, believing\nthat having a large variety of options would be crucial for our December\nlaunch.  Doing so caused major logistical problems, as we kept applicants\non hold for weeks at a time (while reviewing other causes) and then often\nrequested quick turnarounds when we did get back to them.  We seek to avoid\nthis particular problem in the future; we also feel that the five causes we\nhave written up are a sufficient proof of concept; we will thus seek to\nresearch only one cause at a time, until and unless we’re able to hire more\nstaff.\n\nGrant size and structure.  Last year, we offered one-time unrestricted\ngrants of between $25,000 and $40,000.  Whenever a charity declined to\napply, we asked what factored into the decision, and specifically asked\n“whether you would reconsider if the grant size were larger”; of those who\ngave a specific answer to this question, five said they would reconsider\nfor a grant of $100,000+, while two others named different thresholds\n($75,000 and $200,000).  Others who declined and gave reasons did not cite\nthe grant size or structure (see XX for details).  With these observations\nin mind, we believe that we will get our best results next year if we can\npromise that at least one charity per cause will receive $100,000+.\n\nIf most of our “money moved” is in the form of GiveWell Pledges, it may not\nbe feasible to make such a promise; however, if we don’t add any\nsignificant expenses to our current operations, we have enough unrestricted\nfunds to make one $100,000 grant of our own.\n\nChoice of causes\n\nWe wish to factor donor demand into our choice of causes, as much as\npossible; at the same time, we need to have a clear plan and preference at\nall times, so that we don’t take any donations for causes that we end up\nnot researching.\n\nThe following are the causes we plan on offering, in order of priority.  As\nwe start fundraising, GiveWell Pledges will be taken only for the first of\nthese; donors who are interested in other causes will be asked to\ninformally record how much money they would commit to such causes, so that\nwe can contact them if our plans change.\n\n   1. Developing-world direct aid.  The survey data we have (see XX) points\n      to this cause as the best fit for our potential donors; we also feel\n      that there is a great deal of room for more value-added in our\n      research.  This cause includes any charity that seeks to use donations\n      directly (not through research or advocacy) to improve individuals’\n      lives in the developing world, whether through economic empowerment\n      programs (including skills training and microfinance), health\n      programs, education, or programs focused on abandoned children.\n   2. Global warming.  The survey data we have (see XX) points to this cause\n      as the second-best fit for our potential donors.  We believe we can\n      add a great deal to a donor’s understanding of global warming-related\n      options, simply by clearly laying out: (a) which aspects of the\n      problem are agreed on, by broad and partial consensus among\n      researchers; (b) which solutions are being pursued, and what the\n      academic literature says about their viability; (c) which actual\n      activities each relevant charity works on, and what role donations\n      play in these activities.\n   3. Disease research.  [Insert survey data observation.]  We are\n      ambivalent about our ability to add value in this cause.\n   4. Youth development in the U.S.  This cause includes K-12 education,\n      college scholarships, extracurricular activities and early childhood\n      programs – anything aimed at working with children in the hopes of\n      giving them better lives as adults, while not privileging particular\n      ethnicities or career paths.\n   5. Support of U.S. veterans.\n\nGoal 3: Engage more critical thinkers\n\nSo far, critical discussion of our research and reasoning (regarding the\nspecifics of what charities do and whether it works, not GiveWell’s concept\nand model) has come from:\n\n   1. GiveWell staff\n   2. Directors, who have read our writeups and discussed our granting\n      decisions in meetings\n   3. A few people we have specifically sought advice from due to their\n      backgrounds and areas of expertise: professor Dean Karlan of the\n      Poverty Action Lab, Charles Buice of the Tiger Foundation, Professor\n      Richard Murnane (who primarily studies education), two graduate\n      students who are particularly focused on the education-related issues\n      we’ve been dealing with, and one graduate student focused on the\n      research regarding child care.\n   4. GiveWell editors: volunteers (usually made through personal contacts)\n      who have read through our reviews and shared thoughts on our decisions\n      and reasoning.\n   5. Occasional discussions via the comments on our blog, although most\n      discussions on the blog have revolved around our general concept and\n      model, and nearly all discussion of the specifics of our decisions and\n      reasoning has come from the same four people (Michael Vassar, Carl\n      Shulman, Phil Steinmeyer, Dario Amodei).\n\n\nIt is still a relatively small group, and actively seeking out more people\nto engage critically with our reasoning would benefit us in several ways:\n\n    • Improved quality of research, possibly leading to better questions,\n      better analysis, and better giving decisions.\n    • Improved credibility for donors.\n    • Clearer layout and content of website.  We currently have little to go\n      on but our own intuitions regarding how to improve our web content and\n      make it easier to read, understand, and examine critically.  Finding\n      people who are committed to reading our web content and engaging with\n      it would help with this.\n    • Finding potential future staff.  If and when we expand our research\n      staff, we will be looking for people who are highly interested in and\n      intelligent about the issues we work on; a community of critical\n      thinkers would be an ideal source.\n\n\nThis goal does not have the short-term urgency that our first two goals\n(above) do, but to the extent we can, we will aim to:\n\n    • Proactively build advisory boards for the causes we research, with\n      experienced and accomplished people in relevant fields.\n    • Hold periodic meetings to discuss our research – much in the same way\n      we have in Board meetings – with any interested parties.  We have a\n      large list of potential volunteers, and will use this list as a\n      starting point in finding participants.\n\n\nGoal 4: organizational development\n\n\nBoard composition\n\nOur current Board is relatively small, and limited in free time as  well  as\ndiversity of experience.  We seek to actively recruit more members  who  can\nprovide:\n\n    • Expertise  and  experience  on  the  specific  issues  we  study.   As\n      discussed above, we will most likely put people with this  quality  on\n      advisory boards specific to the causes we research.\n    • Perspectives from different relevant backgrounds.   We  would  ideally\n      like  to  have  Board  members   with   experience   in   fundraising,\n      grantmaking, on-the-ground charity work, and management.\n    • Time commitments.  Our current Board is constrained in its ability  to\n      participate in lower-level  decision-making;  we  hope  to  add  Board\n      members who can do more of this.\n\n\nMetrics\n\nWe aim to continually reassess the worthiness and viability of  GiveWell  as\nan organization.  To that end, we need to set goals  and  metrics  that  are\nclear and concrete (while still reflecting the reality that there are a  lot\nof  unknowns  in  our  future,  especially  at  this  early  stage  of   our\ndevelopment).\n\nWe propose the following metrics, though we don’t yet feel equipped  to  set\nspecific targets on them for the year 2008.\n\nMetric: Money moved.\n\nMeasurement: “Money  moved”  equals  the  sum  of:  (a)  grant  money  given\ndirectly by  GiveWell  to  recommended  charities,  including  all  GiveWell\nPledges; (b) individuals’ donations that are given to recommended  charities\nlargely on the strength of  GiveWell’s  recommendation.   Measuring  (a)  is\nstraightforward; we can partly measure (b) by tracking  the  donations  made\nusing the links on GiveWell’s website (currently processed  by  Network  for\nGood).\n\nLong-term target: Over the long run,  we  are  aiming  to  ensure  that  our\n“money moved” is equal to at least 9x  our  operating  expenses  (i.e.,  all\nexpenses other than grants).  While we have no precise  way  of  quantifying\nour value-added (and thus computing the appropriate level of  overhead),  we\nthink we should be able to move enough money to accomplish this goal,  which\nwould put the “overhead” created by GiveWell at a level  that  is  generally\nconsidered acceptable [[SOURCE]].\n\n2008 target: we tentatively hope to move  at  least  $500,000;  we  will  be\nrevising this goal after more  conversations  with  experienced  development\nprofessionals, at which point we will hopefully  know  more  about  what  is\nrealistic.\n\n2007: we moved a total of  $170,000  ($140,000  in  grants  and  $30,000  in\ndonations through GiveWell.net).\n\nMetric: Impact on global discussion.\n\nMeasurement: This is a qualitative metric, intended to examine  whether  the\nconversation around philanthropy is coming more into  line  with  GiveWell’s\nmost important principles.  To “measure” it, we  will  keep  an  archive  of\nrepresentative  discussions  about  philanthropy,  taken  from  publications\n(particularly  the  WSJ,  NYT  and  Chronicle  of  Philanthropy)  and  blogs\n(particularly those  on  the  Chronicle  of  Philanthropy’s  blogroll),  and\nexamine the frequency with which our principles are (a)  engaged  with;  (b)\nagreed upon.\n\nFavorable  trends  would  not  conclusively  establish  GiveWell’s   success\n(because of the question of causality), but  over  the  long  run,  GiveWell\ncannot be considered a success unless the conversation does change.\n\nLong-term target: Our ultimate aim is to foster an active public  discussion\nabout what charities do and whether it works,  something  we  don’t  believe\ncurrently exists.  We hope we will be able to point to both  mainstream  and\nwithin-sector discussions of specific charities’  activities  and  the  hard\nevidence regarding their effectiveness.\n\n2008 target: A downward trend in favorable mentions of  the  “administrative\nexpense ratio” as the primary metric for evaluating charities.\n\n2007: [we’ll fill this in after  looking  more  thoroughly  at  the  various\nsources of “buzz”]\n\n"

We  should  also\n      consider the potential of broad, “top-down” research that  focuses  on\n      identifying good times, places, and ways to help people rather than on\n      evaluating particular organizations.\n    • Another major goal for the coming year will be to recruit people  both\n      for our Board of Directors and cause-specific Advisory Boards.\n    • We plan to create a detailed review of our first year and plan for our\n      next year for review at our next Board meeting.\n\n                            Broad Goals for 2008\n\n1. Development: increase the “money moved” by GiveWell (and be on a path  to\nincreasing it further).  “Money moved” can consist  of  direct  grants  from\nthe Clear Fund to charities, or of individual donations that  are  given  to\nour recommended charities with strong  influence  from  our  recommendations\n(or the combination).\n\nHaving produced quality research and attracted attention, we believe we  are\nnow in position to reach more donors, and that our position is not going  to\nimprove significantly from doing more research.  We think  the  question  of\nhow much money GiveWell can move is the most important  unanswered  question\nabout the project.\n\n2. Research: improve significantly on our understanding of the best ways  to\nhelp people.  The most pressing challenge here is setting our  scope  (i.e.,\nwhich causes we research) in a way that accounts for  what  we  learned  the\nfirst time around and puts us in position to allocate our money as  well  as\npossible.\n\n3. Administration: build a mature  organization  with  a  strong  Board  and\nstructure.\n\n                                 Development\n\n                                 The product\n\nOne way or another, we eventually need to “move”  enough  money  to  justify\nour overhead, or establish that we can’t do so and shut  the  project  down.\nHowever,  while  we  need  to  give  grants  in  order  to  get  access   to\ninformation, there’s a grant size past which more money  is  probably  doing\nlittle for our access to information, and at that point the  question  comes\nup of why donors should give to us rather  than  just  using  our  research.\nInsisting on the “United Way / Robin Hood model” of  pooling  donations  and\ngiving grants has a cost for the donor – ceding the choice of charity to  us\n– that doesn’t seem essential to what we’re offering.\n\nIn order to increase our “money moved” in an active,  measurable  way  while\nleaving donors with as much choice as is feasible,  we  propose  to  solicit\ndonors for  commitments  to  donate  to  our  recommended  charities  (their\nchoice), rather than for direct donations  to  GiveWell.   Such  commitments\nshould be as formal and binding as is practical;  we  may  either  become  a\ndonor advised  fund  or  partner  with  one,  so  that  committed  money  is\nliterally put into an account subject to certain rules.\n\nSetting this up would leave us with three possible “offerings” for a donor:\n\n   1. Donate directly to GiveWell, with the aim of helping us  pay  for  our\n      research activities.\n   2. Donate directly  to  GiveWell  with  the  aim  of  having  your  money\n      “managed,” i.e., cede the choice of specific charity to us.\n   3. Put money in a special account, with a  commitment  to  donate  it  to\n      recommended charities if and when we produce recommendations  in  your\n      field of interest.\n\nWe  propose  to  focus  our  fundraising  on  #3,   raise   #1   only   with\nmajor/institutional donors and  core  supporters,  and  de-emphasize  #2  at\nleast for the time being.\n\nAnother important question about our product is what causes we are going  to\nbe focusing on.  This is discussed under “Research” below.\n\n                                  The plan\n\nOnce we’ve settled our product, we need to actively find  potential  donors.\nThis may include:\n\n   1. Contacting the ~1,000 people who have given us permission  to  contact\n      them  when  submitting  surveys  on  our  website,  focusing  on   the\n      particularly high-potential ones we’ve been discussing in our biweekly\n      reports.\n   2. Explicitly targeting particular industries and  companies  to  present\n      at.\n   3. Arranging fundraising events with the aim of getting existing GiveWell\n      contacts to bring friends.\n\nThough our existing staff can pursue these approaches, we feel  there  is  a\nstrong case for conducting an active search –  and  offering  a  competitive\nsalary – for an experienced, talented Development Director.\n\n    •   Unlike   the   work   we’ve    been    focusing    on    to    date,\n      development/fundraising is  an  established  and  largely  generalized\n      discipline, and there is a lot of public discussion and study of  what\n      works.\n    • We have no experience with development,  and  we  don’t  consider  the\n      associated skills to be among current staff’s strengths.\n    • In particular, we have little to no sense of  how  to  set  reasonable\n      expectations for our project in this area.  One way or another, having\n      an experienced fundraiser become intimately familiar with our  project\n      and position seems necessary for setting reasonable expectations.\n    • A good Development Director would be able to set  a  long-term  growth\n      plan and execute on it, as well as take a  major  role  in  GiveWell’s\n      public  communications.   S/he  would  thereby  address  most  of  the\n      weaknesses and non-strengths of current staff, and potentially take or\n      share the Executive Director role.\n    • Unlike evaluating potential  program  staff,  evaluating  a  potential\n      Development Director seems relatively straightforward.\n    • Although such a person would likely command a high salary, it would be\n      relatively easy to continually assess whether the investment is  worth\n      it.  We may try to secure an institutional  grant  for  this  expense,\n      since institutional funders  are  likely  to  be  more  interested  in\n      helping us expand than in using our research for their own grants.\n\n                                  Research\n\nThis section focuses on setting our scope (which causes we’re. covering).\n\nIn choosing our causes, we are going to seek to do  one  broad  cause  at  a\ntime (unless there is enough demand for more to justify hiring more  staff),\nand take donor preferences heavily into account – i.e.,  in  the  course  of\nraising money, we are going to ask  donors  to  specify  which  causes  they\nwould donate for, and leave the  option  open  of  switching  our  plans  to\naccommodate more donors.\n\nAt this point, the cause we feel is the  best  fit  for  the  next  year  is\ndeveloping-world  direct  aid,  including  health,  microfinance  and  other\neconomic assistance, education, and  abandoned  children.   Developing-world\naid was more popular than developed-world aid in our online survey,  and  we\nfeel that we have a very concrete sense of what to investigate  and  how  to\nadd value in these areas.\n\nWe’d also like to note two other potential  causes  that  would  expand  our\nscope well beyond the sort of work we’ve been doing so far:\n\n1. Global warming and (possibly) other catastrophe aversion.   Environmental\nissues, particularly global warming, were extremely popular  in  our  online\nsurvey.  We are generally unfamiliar with these  issues,  and  have  only  a\nmoderate sense for what to investigate and  how  to  add  value.   Comparing\ndifferent “global catastrophe” issues has some potential advantages: we  see\na clearer path to value-added in  listing  and  comparing  options  than  in\ncommitting ourselves to looking  deeply  into  global  warming  issues,  and\ndoing so would increase our appeal to a particular  group  of  intellectuals\nthat we would like to see engaging more with GiveWell.\n\n2. Extremely broad analysis of donors’ options – publishing, side  by  side,\nvery basic analysis of many  options  rather  than  thorough,  organization-\nlevel analysis of a  few.   For  example,  publishing  a  thorough  list  of\ndiseases, symptoms, global burdens, and money spent  per  year  on  research\ncould be a valuable source of information to donors  even  if  it  does  not\ncompare charities side-by-side.\n\nNote that:\n\n    • All of these causes are far broader than the causes we  researched  in\n      our startup year.  This change is based largely on our frustration the\n      first time around with having to give one grant per cause, rather than\n      allocate more money to the causes  we  preferred  (i.e.,  causes  with\n      stronger organizations and more “bang for  your  buck”).   We  believe\n      that trying to narrow causes to the  point  where  we  can  make  true\n      “apples to apples” comparisons is likely futile  and  not  worthwhile;\n      instead, we want to be able to review many different sorts of options,\n      let donors decide what appeals to them most, and  allocate  any  grant\n      money of our own to what appeals to us most.\n\n    • For all three of the causes above, it is possible that we would take a\n      much more “top-down” approach to research than we did  for  our  first\n      year.  Rather than starting with a grant application and  getting  our\n      understanding of different approaches  from  our  applicants,  we  may\n      start  with  independent  research,  looking  for  publicly  published\n      evidence of what works, and then specifically  target  (and  evaluate)\n      organizations whose activities match what we find.\n\n                               Administration\n\n    • We believe it is important to find more  Board  members  who  can  add\n      experience and different perspectives to our  project.   Staff  has  a\n      list of potential Board  members  available;  we  have  discussed  the\n      possibility with some, and not yet with others.\n    • We would also like to form Advisory Boards, separate from our Board of\n      Directors, whose role is to advise  on  recommendations  for  specific\n      causes (i.e., each cause will have its own Advisory Board).\n    • Other goals under this heading include:\n         o Formalizing our metrics and setting clear and public  goals  for\n           GiveWell.\n         o Formalizing our policies, procedures, and roles for  both  Board\n           and staff.\n         o Writing up a thorough look back at our first year,  including  a\n           thorough analysis of our survey data and more generally of  what\n           went well, what went poorly, and what we’ve learned.\n"

          "text": "\n                 Report on Professional Development Options\n\nWe have agreed that the co-Founders and current sole employees  of  GiveWell\n– and in particular Holden Karnofsky, the hopeful Executive Director –  lack\nlife  and  business  experience,  and  would  benefit  from  a  professional\ndevelopment effort: a concerted effort to learn from  those  who  have  such\nexperience.\n\nAfter investigating many options, including the  leads  that  Board  members\nsent  us,  we  believe  that  the  most  promising  paths  to   professional\ndevelopment are, in order:\n\n   1. Establishing mentor relationships with GiveWell  supporters  who  have\n      relevant skills and experience.   Doing  so  will  be  a  gradual  and\n      challenging process, as it’s essential to both identify and  win  over\n      successful and helpful people.\n   2. Joining a new social entrepreneurship group at the Harvard  Club.   Of\n      the (relatively) open-invitation programs we’ve seen, this is the only\n      one that we are both eligible for and feel we might gain from.\n   3. Possibly applying for fellowships in competitive  programs.   We  will\n      have to weigh  the  potential  benefits  against  the  time  costs  of\n      applying.\n\n1. Mentor relationships\n\nWe believe that the most  direct  path  to  accomplishing  our  professional\ndevelopment  goals  is  establishing  mentor  relationships  with   GiveWell\nsupporters who have relevant skills and experience.  Specifically, we will:\n\n    • Seek people with experience with  productive  and  successful  startup\n      businesses, either through founding (and working on) such startups  or\n      working as a venture capitalist or consultant to help ventures grow.\n    • Ask each potential mentor to receive our biweekly reports.\n    • Discuss each biweekly report (via phone, email,  or  in  person)  with\n      each mentor.\n\nWe feel that our biweekly reports give a good picture  of  how  we’re  using\nour time and what tactical and strategic decisions  we’re  making.   Sharing\nand discussing them with supporters is the most direct  way  to  learn  from\npeople with relevant skills and experience, in a  way  that  stays  directly\nrelevant to the work we’re doing at GiveWell.\n\nWe expect finding mentors to be a difficult and  gradual  process,  for  the\nsame  reason  that  finding  strong  professional  development  options   is\ngenerally difficult:  we  need  to  find  people  who  are  experienced  and\nsuccessful yet willing to invest significant time in us.\n\nOur current top candidates for mentors are:\n\n\nInformation on specific individuals withheld from  public  version  of  this\ndocument\n\n\nWe currently have two mentors.  We hope to have four by June 1, 2009.\n\n2. Formal, open-invitation entrepreneurship groups\n\nWe  have  had  little  success  locating  open-invitation   entrepreneurship\ngroups.  Even where we have found them, there is a large question of how  to\nassess the quality of the participants.\n\nAt this point, Holden is planning on going to the first  meeting  of  a  new\n“Social Entrepreneurship / Non-Profit Career Group” organized  by  a  former\nclassmate of his, via the Harvard Club of New York.  He has  had  relatively\nlimited interaction with this  classmate,  but  enough  to  prioritize  this\ngroup above the few others we have found (via meetup.com).\n\nWe also see  promise  in  the  EONetwork,  an  entrepreneurship  group  that\nmatches our needs well; it  coordinates  monthly  meetings  with  relatively\nsmall groups of entrepreneurs, all of whom  must  be  the  principal  of  an\norganization with $1 million or more in  annual  sales.   However,  we  have\nbeen told that  we  are  ineligible  both  for  this  program  and  for  the\naffiliated Accelerator program (for businesses with $250,000-$1  million  in\nannual sales) because we are a nonprofit.\n\n3. Competitive programs\n\nWe have identified  several  competitive  programs  that  provide  intensive\nmentoring, and in some cases funding.\n\nProgram name: Ashoka\nApplication deadline: rolling\nFirst step: an email nominating GiveWell (see http://ashoka.org/nominate)\nApplication process: relatively  vague.   Website  contains  no  information\naside from the nomination process; we called and asked for more details  but\nwere not given any, aside from a very rough  and  informal  guess  that  the\nprocess could be expected to take somewhere around 3 months.\nMentoring: very vague: “We also provide our Fellows with  a  global  support\nnetwork of their peers and partnerships with professional consultants.”\nOther benefits: “a living stipend for an average of  three  years,  allowing\nthem to focus full-time on building their institutions and  spreading  their\nideas.”  Ashoka is also relatively prestigious.\n\nProgram name: Echoing Green\nApplication deadline: Dec. 1 for first-round online application\nFirst step: online application.  Would probably take a few hours.\nApplication process: “mailed  materials”  (unspecified)  due  Feb.  9.   In-\nperson interviews at selection weekend, April 30-May 2.   Results  announced\nat the end of May.\nMentoring: “We provide technical assistance and consultations  to  help  new\nleaders build organizations, increase  their  organization’s  capacity,  and\nmanage  growth.  We  also  facilitate  peer-to-peer  learning   to   enhance\nleadership skills and ensure organizational sustainability.  We harness  the\nexperience and expertise of our global network of  social  entrepreneurs  to\nshare best practices and ensure success for all.”\nOther benefits: funding (unspecified amount).  “We provide  seed  grants  to\nhelp Echoing Green Fellows transform innovative ideas into action.”\n\nProgram name: Draper Richards Foundation\nApplication deadline: Rolling\nFirst step: 3page proposal.\nApplication process: very unclear.  From the phone conversation,  it  sounds\nlike  a  relatively  non-systemized  process,  i.e.,  like  applying  to   a\nfoundation.  “I think that you would have a down easier than an up within  a\nshort period of time, the directors try to get back to the fellows within  2\nweeks to a month for the initial contact, it can take a couple months,  it’s\ndefinitely not something that’s rushed.”  I continued pressing  for  a  time\nestimate and eventually got them to estimate “2-3 months.”\nMentoring: “We provide portfolio organizations with strategic guidance and\ncoaching, often by taking an active role as a board member, with focus\ngiven to fundamentals that build strong and sustainable organizations\nincluding governance, fund development and data gathering for long-term\nevaluation.”\nOther benefits: $100,000 annually for three years.\n\nProgram name: StartingBloc\nApplication Deadline: December 1\nFirst step: Online application with a few essays – probably 1-2 hours.\nApplication process: Notifications Jan 15.\nMentoring: there are 3 different programs, all of them basically short,\nhigh-intensity workshops (1-2 weekends).  They look fairly basic: “Finance\nBasics, Business Plan Writing, and How to Attract Investors and Donors. The\nInstitute will also offer additional networking events, thus facilitating\ngreater interactions between Fellows.”  Graduates “enter the alumni\nnetwork.”  Unclear exactly what that means.\nOther benefits: N/A.  $450 fee for NY; $1200 for London.\n\n\nOther, lower-priority approaches to professional development\n\n\nWe see a small amount of potential value in entrepreneurship-related books\n(The Mouse Driver Chronicles; Founders at Work) and blogs (Seth Godin; Guy\nKawasaki).  Given our learning styles, we feel that books and blogs offer\nmost of the benefits that formal courses would.\n\nWe have three resources that we can turn to for highly specific questions\nthat our official mentors can’t answer: SCORE NYC, the Small Business\nDevelopment Center at Baruch College, and an active Harvard-Startups email\nlist that Holden subscribes to.\n\n\n\n\nOther leads we pursued\n\n\n    • Backpocket COO: coaching/mentoring services offered by Cameron Herold\n      (whom we encountered via a blog post on entrepreneurship that we\n      related to).  We find the cost prohibitive at $3500/mo.\n    • NetImpact: cites networking opportunities, but seems more focused on\n      social change than on entrepreneurship.\n    • Social Venture Network: claims “networking opportunities” but has no\n      specifics.  The organization and its events are in SF.\n    • Harvard Business School and Columbia Business School: both have\n      Executive Education programs that would likely eat up significant\n      time, and we have little confidence that they would be relevant enough\n      to justify it.  We called both asking for more informal networking\n      opportunities and got nowhere.\n    • Social Enterprise Institute: offers formal programs in Texas; emailed\n      them asking for leads and got no response.\n    • Endeavor: a social entrepreneur program that focuses on the developing\n      world.\n    • Emerging Practitioners in Philanthropy: a group centered on nonprofit\n      employees (not founders).\n    • Open Society Institute: we were referred here by two different people,\n      but calling and emailing led us nowhere (the guy I talked to said he\n      had no idea what I was talking about, and the email response said that\n      the Open Society Institute does not facilitate or know of the kind of\n      networking opportunities we’re looking for).\n    • IPE Group – recommended by a Board member’s contact, but appears\n      inactive since at least January ’08 and does not address\n      entrepreneurship.\n"

It will recommend several\n      charities per cause (including one for each subcause, outlined in the\n      body of our vision document) and provides basic ratings for much\n      larger numbers of charities.\n    • Capacity and operating funding: GiveWell will have a staff of about\n      twenty, and operate on about $1.7 million per year.  Its staff will be\n      sufficient to provide broad, deep research as well as maintaining an\n      excellent website and active marketing efforts.\n    • Money moved: GiveWell will affect a large amount of money – at least\n      $15 million, 9 times operating costs – through a variety of methods\n      outlined in the body of this document.\n    • High-credibility/high-visibility supporters: GiveWell will have a 10-\n      person Board of Directors, composed primarily of major donors who are\n      successful and well-connected in the for-profit world.  It will also\n      maintain a separate Advisory Board for each broad cause covered by its\n      research, composed of 3-10 people with significant expertise in that\n      particular area.\n    • Brand value / name recognition:  GiveWell will occupy a place in\n      annual coverage of giving similar to that currently occupied by\n      Charity Navigator.  It will be covered in multiple mainstream media\n      pieces during giving season of each year.  Its research will be\n      frequently referenced and linked to in online blog posts and\n      discussions of relevant issues.\n\nEach of the above variables (depth/breadth/presentation of research;\ncapacity and operating funding; money moved; high-credibility/high-\nvisibility supporters; brand value / name recognition) has the potential to\ninfluence the others, and there are multiple paths we might take to get to\nour vision.\n\nThe path we are focused on now, outlined in a separate document, focuses\nfor the short term on the depth, breadth, and presentation of our research;\npromoting our research and pursuing customers is a secondary priority until\nour research is substantially deeper and broader.  We estimate that\nreaching the depth and breadth of research outlined in this document will\ntake approximately 3-6 years and require $1.5-2.5m in operating expenses.\n\n\n                                   Details\n\n\n\nThe product: depth, breadth, and presentation of research\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth, breadth, and presentation of research: end goal\n\n\nGiveWell will publish a report each year on each of the causes listed\nbelow.[1]\n\n    • For each broad (first-order) cause, GiveWell will publish a review of\n      literature on the most promising interventions.\n    • For each narrower (second-order) cause, GiveWell will publish a list\n      of charities working in this area, along with the interventions they\n      focus on, and will aim to recommend at least one charity within each\n      second-order cause.\n    • Recommended charities will have more in-depth reviews than other\n      listed charities; reviews will be similar to those currently at\n      www.givewell.net and will include discussion of financials, monitoring\n      & evaluation reports, and site visits.\n    • GiveWell will also publish some ratings system for all charities\n      working in each area.\n\nGiveWell’s research will be available at several different levels of\ndetail, putting recommendations and highlights up front for those with\nlittle time and linking to the full, referenced details for others.  It\nwill be presented as intuitively and engagingly as possible.\n\n1) Developing-world aid\n   a) Direct health interventions\n   b) Advocacy for legislative health interventions (micronutrient\n      fortification, tobacco taxes, highway safety, etc.)\n   c) Economic empowerment programs (microfinance, agricultural training,\n      irrigation, etc.)\n   d) Targeted research on neglected developing-world-specific diseases (for\n      example, development of vaccines for malaria and tuberculosis)\n   e) Care, support and adoption of OVC (orphans and vulnerable children)\n   f) Interventions targeted at child slavery and sex slavery\n   g) Primary and secondary education (scholarships, school building)\n   h) Disaster relief and reconstruction\n2) Disease research: cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, etc.\n3) Global warming mitigation/prevention\n   a) Research on alternative energy\n   b) Research on improved prediction models\n   c) Advocacy for appropriate legislation (carbon tax, etc.)\n   d) Programs targeted at helping individuals reduce energy consumption\n4) Equality of opportunity in the U.S.\n   a) Early childhood care\n   b) K-12 education\n   c) K-12 youth development (non-academic)\n   d) College preparation and scholarship programs\n   e) Employment assistance and training programs\n5) Mitigation of suffering in the U.S.\n   a) Food, shelter, etc. for homeless and other extremely low-income people\n   b) Hospice care\n   c) Financial and other support of veterans, widows, and other non-self-\n      supporting people\n   d) Financial and other support of OVC\n   e) Care of the mentally and physically disabled\n6) Tolerance in the U.S.\n   a) Prevention/reduction of violence against women\n   b) Civil rights\n   c) Aid for immigrants\n7) Animal welfare\n\n\nDepth, breadth, and presentation of research: how we’ll get to the end goal\noutlined above\n\n\nKey variables are time and capacity/operating funding.\n\n\n\nOur rough estimate that one “broad cause” should take approximately four\n“man-years” of Holden’s and Elie’s time.  In our first year, the two of us\ncovered three of the areas listed under “Equality of opportunity in the\nU.S.” as well as a preliminary analysis of developing-world health and\neconomic empowerment.  In our second year, we believe we will be able to\ncover about half of what we’ve listed above under developing-world aid.\n\nThis estimate could be overly optimistic because:\n\n    • We set regional restrictions for our first year; lifting these, and\n      covering a broad range of regions, could lead to more work.  We do not\n      anticipate covering every city in the U.S. or every country in Africa,\n      but we hope to cover a few different regions as well as recommending\n      at least one large national/international organization.\n    • We hope to improve the quality (depth) of our recommendations, and in\n      particular to get more personal exposure to the organizations and\n      regions under review.\n\nThis estimate could be overly pessimistic because:\n\n    • We anticipate improving our efficiency as we learn from our\n      experiences and develop improved approaches (as we have already done\n      from year 1 to year 2).\n    • As our “money moved” and brand value grow, we anticipate getting more\n      information, more easily, from charities.\n    • We also anticipate growing our volunteer corps and our ability to\n      leverage them (something that has already happened from year 1 to year\n      2).  We may also be able to pay particularly capable people, such as\n      graduate students in relevant fields, part-time.\n\nAssuming that the estimate is appropriate, that Holden and Elie will each\nbe able to spend at least 50% of their time on research, and that associate\nresearchers are at least 50% as productive as Holden and Elie, leads to the\nestimate that GiveWell should be able to cover .5 + N/8 broad causes per\nyear, where N is the number of new research staff hired.\n\n\nDepth, breadth, presentation of research: important milestones\n\n\nCurrent status: we have relatively low-depth research (with heavy use of\nheuristics and very few recommended charities) on 1a, 1c, 4a, 4b, 4c.\n\nMilestone: high-depth research of a single broad cause, with at least one\nrecommended charity within each subcause.  We are currently working on this\ngoal for developing-world aid.  Reaching it will likely not only improve\nour appeal to donors interested in this particular cause, but will give us\na better sense of the time and resources necessary for deep research.\n\nMilestone: low-depth research of all broad causes listed above, with at\nleast one recommended charity for each broad cause.  Reaching this\nmilestone may improve our ability to pursue several different strategies\nfor increasing “money moved,” particularly those for which breadth of\nresearch is key (see #2-4 under “Money moved” below).  It may also improve\nour sense of the total amount of time and resources needed to reach our\nultimate goal.\n\nHigh-depth research for each of the above broad causes is a milestone that\nwill improve the breadth of our appeal to donors.\n\n\nCapacity and operating funding\n\n\n\nCapacity and operating funding: end goal\n\n\nGiveWell will employ:\n\n\n    • Two Co-Founders @ $250,000 ea.\n    • One Marketing Director @ $150,000\n    • One website specialist (full-time employee responsible for making our\n      website as usable and engaging as possible) @ $75,000\n    • Ten research associates @ $50,000 ea.\n    • Five administrative/support associates @ $35,000 ea.\n\nAll figures are inclusive of payroll taxes and benefits.\n\nOther expenses will include:\n\n    • Expenses and auditing fees: $15,000\n    • Subscriptions and research expenses: $5,000\n    • Advertising/PR expenses: $50,000\n    • Rent: $16,000 per month\n    • Misc: $15,000\n\nTotal expenses will be around $1.7 million per year.\n\n\nCapacity and operating funding: how we’ll get to the end goal outlined\nabove\n\n\nThe key variables in building this capacity are time and operating funding.\n Potential funders include:\n\n    • Foundations, such as Hewlett, Gates, Robert Wood Johnson, Packard,\n      Skoll, Ford, Charles Stewart Mott, Knight, Kellogg, Koch\n    • Core individual donors, including\n         o Former coworkers (~$300k/yr)\n         o Other individuals who have become extremely invested in our\n           mission (have accounted for $38,000 so far in 2008-09)\n\nThe following table gives examples of other organizations with a general\nmandate of serving the philanthropy sector, and funding from the\nfoundations listed above.\n\n\n           [pic]\n\nWe expect that our ability to raise funding for the above expenses will\nhinge on our ability to demonstrate that the other aspects of this vision –\nnamely, quality research that moves a significant amount of money – will\naccompany them.  The key variables are thus the key indicators for the\nother aspects of this vision:\n\n    • Depth, breadth, and presentation quality of research\n    • High-credibility/high-visibility supporters\n    • Money moved\n\n\nCapacity and operating funding: key milestones\n\n\nCurrent status: 2 Co-Founders; no office; minimal expenses.\n\nEach new hire, once integrated, will materially increase our capacity to\nmove other key variables.\n\n\nMoney moved\n\n\n\nMoney moved: end goal\n\n\n“Money moved” refers to  the  sum  of  (a)  grants  given  directly  by  the\nGiveWell  and  (b)  individual  donations  that  are  made  to   recommended\ncharities, with the choice of charities directly attributable to  GiveWell’s\nresearch.\n\nWe intend to maximize the “money moved” by GiveWell,  but  the  minimum  for\ncontinuing  to  operate  will  be  9  times  its  operating   expenses,   or\napproximately $15 million.   Sources  of  “money  moved”  will  include  the\nfollowing; for each, the importance of each key variable is specified.\n\n\nMoney moved: how we’ll get to the end goal outlined above\n\n\n\n   1. Donations directly  from  www.givewell.net  from  donors  specifically\n      seeking its recommendations.  Such donors will find GiveWell through:\n        a. Advertising targeted at potential customers (our current profile\n           of a potential customer is someone who is between 24 and 40  and\n           makes between $100,000 and $1,000,000 per year).  Key variables:\n           operating funds available for advertising; depth,  breadth,  and\n           presentation of research.\n        b. Earned media – see “Brand value / name recognition” below.\n   2. Donations made through GiveWell’s partners: other  websites  aimed  at\n      raising and facilitating online  giving,  which  will  use  GiveWell’s\n      content for substantive recommendations.  Key variables:  breadth  and\n      presentation of research; high-credibility/high-visibility supporters;\n      brand value / name recognition.  Note that some partnerships should be\n      possible at our current stage.  Such websites include:\n        a. Websites focusing on financial data for charities\n               1. GuideStar.org\n               2. Charity Navigator\n               3. Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance\n               4. CharityWatch.org (American Institute of Philanthropy)\n        b. Donation sites\n               1. NetworkForGood.org\n               2. JustGive.org\n        c. Social networking charity sites\n               1. Change.org\n               2. SixDegrees.org\n               3. YourCause,com\n   3. Partnerships with corporate giving and matching programs, which  often\n      (though every company is different) support and  recommend  particular\n      charities.  Key variables: breadth, presentation  of  research;  high-\n      credibility/high-visibility   supporters;   brand   value    /    name\n      recognition.\n   4. Partnerships with donor-advised funds (such as those run by  Vanguard,\n      Fidelity and Schwab), which represent pools of  money  that  has  been\n      committed to charitable giving in general  but  not  to  any  specific\n      charity.  Key variables:  breadth,  presentation  of  research;  high-\n      credibility/high-visibility   supporters;   brand   value    /    name\n      recognition.\n   5. Partnerships with individual wealth advisors.  Key  variables:  depth,\n      breadth, presentation  of  research;  high-credibility/high-visibility\n      supporters; brand value / name recognition.\n   6.  Partnerships  with  fundraisers  who  focus  on  causes  rather  than\n      organizations.  Key variables: depth of research, brand value.\n   7. GiveWell Pledges and GiveWell Project Funding (explanation below) from\n      donors who are highly committed to  GiveWell.   Donors  will  opt  for\n      these because of the extra recognition (from GiveWell) that comes with\n      them as well as the added  benefits  from  an  altruistic  perspective\n      (detailed below).  GiveWell will find donors to participate  in  these\n      programs by:\n        a. Contacting those who have made major gifts through  the  website\n           before (and have given consent to be contacted).\n        b. Arranging to speak at companies and conferences that are  likely\n           to have large numbers of potential customers.  Target  companies\n           include those in the  software,  venture  capital,  and  finance\n           industries, all of which often have large numbers of  relatively\n           young people with relatively high disposable incomes.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n    • A GiveWell Pledge is a formal, advance commitment to give  to  one  of\n      our recommended charities from the next round of research in  a  given\n      area.  See http://www.givewell.net/plan\n    • GiveWell Project Funding is not currently offered, and may or may  not\n      be in the future.  It represents the opportunity to commit  a  certain\n      amount to fund a discrete project (not  an  unrestricted  gift  to  an\n      organization) recommended by GiveWell’s research team.  GiveWell  will\n      raise commitments  for  GiveWell  Project  Funding,  list  recommended\n      projects, and then let  donors  who  have  committed  funds  rank  the\n      projects in their order of preference to determine which  get  funded.\n      This setup will  help  donors  to  coordinate  their  funds  and  fund\n      discrete projects, an ability that is currently  generally  restricted\n      to larger funders.\n\n\nMoney moved: key milestones\n\n\nCurrent status: The total “money moved” for our first year of  research  was\napproximately $175,000.  Our current research has about $150,000 pledged  to\nit (in the form of GiveWell Pledges as well  as  restricted  donations);  we\nexpect the final “money moved” figure  to  be  higher,  as  having  concrete\nrecommendations will appeal to donors  who  weren’t  willing  to  commit  in\nadvance.  (Also, several donors  have  yet  to  specify  numbers  for  their\nGiveWell Pledges).\n\nMilestones: Reaching $1 million, $5 million, and $10 million in money  moved\nmay have some impact on our general  credibility,  and  on  our  ability  to\ngenerate earned media.\n\n\nHigh-credibility/high-visibility supporters\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-credibility/high-visibility supporters: end goal\n\n\nGiveWell will have a 10-person Board of Directors, composed primarily of\nmajor donors who are successful and well-connected in the for-profit world.\n At least two slots will be held by people with significant experience in\nthe nonprofit sector.\n\nFor each of the broad causes listed below, GiveWell will maintain a\nseparate Advisory Board composed of 3-10 people with significant expertise\nin that particular area.  Each Advisory Board will include people with both\nacademic expertise (i.e., familiarity with the relevant literature) and on-\nthe-ground expertise (i.e., significant personal experience with relevant\nnonprofit work, and the relevant regions and populations).\n\nGiveWell will also seek the support – via GiveWell Pledges and endorsements\n– of as many other high-credibility/high-visibility people as possible.\n\n\nHigh-credibility/high-visibility supporters: how we’ll get to the end goal\noutlined above\n\n\nWe will actively pursue relationships with potential Directors and\nAdvisors.  We expect that the case for their involvement will be\nstrengthened by the following key variables:\n\n    • Money moved\n    • High-credibiliy/high-visibility supporters (this goal is self-\n      reinforcing)\n    • Brand value / name recognition\n\n\nHigh/credibility/high-visibility supporters: key milestones\n\n\nCurrent status: our Board of Directors has 6 members, 2 of whom have\nsubstantial nonprofit sector experience and 2 of whom have substantial for-\nprofit sector experience.  We have two Advisory Board members; one is a\nrelatively high-profile professor and another has a fairly strong resume in\ndeveloping-world health, having been in charge of metrics and evaluation\nfor both Partners in Health and the Millennium Villages Project.\n\nMilestones: Each Board member or Advisory Board member recruited will be a\nminor milestone, improving our credibility and ability to reach more\ncandidates.\n\n\nBrand value / name recognition\n\n\n\nBrand value / name recognition: end goal\n\n\nGiveWell will occupy a place in annual coverage of giving  similar  to  that\ncurrently occupied by Charity Navigator.  It will  be  covered  in  multiple\nmainstream media pieces during giving season of  each  year.   Its  research\nwill be frequently referenced  and  linked  to  in  online  blog  posts  and\ndiscussions of  relevant  issues  (including,  for  example,  education  and\nforeign aid).\n\n\nBrand value / name recognition: how we’ll get to the end goal outlined\nabove\n\n\nWe expect that the most promising avenues to earned media coverage will be:\n\n    • Cultivating relationships with members of the media.   Key  variables:\n      time; progress on research (which will give us newsworthy findings  to\n      publish).\n    • High-credibility/high-visibility endorsers and supporters.\n    • Money moved.\n\nWe expect that the promising avenues to more frequent coverage from  smaller\nonline communities will be:\n\n    • Depth, breadth, presentation of research.\n    • High-credibility/high-visibility endorsers and supporters.\n\n-----------------------\n[1]  Note that the creation of the initial report – incorporating a review\nof academic research, search for relevant organizations, etc. – will be far\nmore time-consuming than updating a report each year (which will require\nonly reviewing new materials released both by academics and charities, as\nwell as evaluating any new charities that apply).\n\n"

          "text": "\n                 Tactical plan: 11/10/2008 through 6/1/2009\n\n\nIntroduction/summary\n\n\nGiveWell’s ultimate vision is of a world in which:\n\n    • Individual donors can easily find actionable information about what\n      charities do and whether it works.\n    • A large amount of money from these donors flows systematically to the\n      charities with the most proven, cost-effective, scalable ways of\n      helping people.\n    • This dynamic – charities competing for funding based on demonstrated\n      impact – leads to an ongoing public dialogue about how to help people,\n      and to constant improvement in the way charitable resources are\n      allocated.\n\nOur vision document lays out the specific assets we feel we’ll need to\nreach this vision:\n\n   1. Staff capacity (and the operating funds to pay for it)\n   2. Depth, breadth, and presentation quality of research\n   3. Money moved\n   4. High-credibility/high-visibility supporters\n   5. Brand value / name recognition\n\nWe feel that the appropriate focus for our next year is on #1 and #2\nbecause:\n\n    • We are unlikely to make significant progress on #3-5 given the current\n      state of #1-2.\n    • We may make more progress on #3-5 if we had significantly deeper and\n      broader research.\n    • Serious progress on #1-2 is well within our reach, and is unlikely to\n      be affected much by #3-5.\n\nOur priorities for the coming year, in order, are as follows.\n\nPriority 1: hire a Research Analyst in order to improve our ability to\naccomplish our other goals (below).\nTime allocation: approximately 5 hours per week devoted to recruiting\n(prior to the hire) and management/review (after the hire is made).\nDeliverable: hire one Research Analyst by Jan. 1, 2008.  Complete thorough\nreview of hire by Mar. 30, 2008.\n\nPriority 2: Complete an in-depth research report on developing-world aid,\nwhile systemizing as much as possible of the research process.  Doing so\nwill add greatly to our understanding of the time and resources necessary\nto reach the level of research laid out in our vision document; it will\nalso improve our appeal to donors and high-credibility/high-visibility\nsupporters interested in this cause.\nTime allocation: approximately 40 hours per week of Holden’s and Elie’s\ntime, and 25 hours per week of the Research Analyst’s time.\nDeliverable: in-depth research report on developing-world aid completed by\n6/1/2009.  See below for details on the contents of this report.\n\nPriority 3: Continue to pursue customers in order to a) measure demand and\nb) get substantive feedback on the materials we produce.\nTime allocation: approximately 10 hours per week of Holden’s and Elie’s\ntime.\nDeliverable: none as of now.  Progress on metrics (directly below) will be\nmonitored and assessed after the fact.\nMetrics:\n    • Money moved (defined as the to the sum of Clear Fund grants, GiveWell\n      Pledges, and all other donations that are directly attributable to\n      GiveWell’s research).\n    • Money moved through donors who know us only from GiveWell.\n    • Number of donations moved through donors who know us only from\n      GiveWell.\n    • Links from other blogs and websites (taking into consideration the\n      significance, as measured by Alexa and Technorati rank, of these blogs\n      and websites).\n    • Mentions in mainstream media.\n    • Traffic to website and blog.\n    • Subscribers to blog and email list(s).\n    • Partnerships with donor advised funds, wealth advisors, and online\n      donor resources.\n\nPriority 4: Pursue important relationships including:\n    • Successful supporters to serve as mentors and members of the Board of\n      Directors\n    • Partners who can help us reach potential users of our research\n    • Donors who can increase our money moved and continue to build our\n      network\n    • High-credibility supporters for our Advisory Board\nTime allocation: approximately 15 hours per week of Holden’s and Elie’s\ntime.\nDeliverable by 6/1/2009:\n    • A total of three experienced entrepreneurs who serve as mentors to us\n      on a regular basis.  (We currently have one.)\n    • A total of five highly credible and/or visible figures who serve on\n      our Advisory Board and endorse our research.  (We currently have two.)\n\nTotal hours per week add to 70, out of our average of 80.  The remaining 10\nare allocated to miscellaneous tasks such as accounting and legal issues\nand Board-related communications.\n\nBelow, we lay out specific plans for pursuing these priorities.\n\n\nGoal 1: expand our staff\n\n\nWe aim to hire one Research Analyst by Jan. 1, 2008.  In hiring, we will\nstart with our existing base of volunteers, and seek the following\nqualities:\n\n    • Strong analytical abilities.\n    • Strong interest in GiveWell.\n    • A good work ethic.\n\nThe Research Analyst will be paid a salary of $35,000 per year plus health\nbenefits.  Including employer payroll taxes and the cost of health\nbenefits, the total cost to GiveWell of the Research Analyst will be\napproximately $41,500 per year.\n\nThe responsibilities of the Research Analyst will primarily be:\n\n    • Examining the websites and annual reports of over 800 charities and\n      summarizing their activities.\n    • Examining and summarizing the academic literature on 15 categories of\n      developing-world interventions.\n    • Examining and summarizing the academic literature on a set of other\n      relevant questions such as the relationship between health and\n      economic growth, and the possible negative effects of international\n      aid.\n\nMore on what the Research Analyst will do and how we will evaluate and\nmanage him/her will be written up in our Research Analyst Hiring Document.\n\nWe believe that the nature of our research plan and the clarity of our\nexpectations merit a hire.  This was not the case when we made a previous\nhire in late 2007.\n\nAfter we have worked with the Research Analyst for 3 full months and\ncompleted our first quarterly review, we will reassess our needs and\ndetermine whether we should hire further, scale back, or stay at the\ncurrent staff level.  For now, the only goal we are committing to is the\nhiring of one capable Research Analyst.\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n11/14/2008 – writeup completed on prospective salaries, duties, and\nevaluation for new hire.  Two top candidates contacted and asked to\ncomplete a preliminary project if interested.\n\n11/28/2008 – Preliminary projects due.\n\n12/2/2008 – preliminary evaluation of preliminary projects completed.  Hire\nis made if possible; if neither of the top two candidates demonstrates both\ninterest and a strong preliminary project, we broaden the search by:\n\n    • Posting the position opening on our blog.\n    • Contacting several friends whom we believe will provide us with\n      referrals.\n    • Public postings via sites such as Monster.com and Doostang.com if we\n      do not receive applications within a few days.\n\n12/9/2008 – preliminary project given to interested applicants.\n\n12/23/2008 – preliminary projects due.\n\nHire made by Monday, Jan. 5.\n\n1/5/2009 – 1/12/2009 – training period for new hire.\n\n1/19/2009 – first formal audit and evaluation of new hire, focusing on\nexecution of instructions.\n\n1/26/2009 – second audit and evaluation of new hire.\n\n2/16/2009 – third audit and evaluation of new hire.\n\n3/2/2009 – fourth audit and evaluation of new hire.\n\n3/30/2009 – fifth audit and evaluation of new hire, focusing on value\nadded.  At this point, we will give most serious consideration to whether\nto continue the relationship.\n\n\nGoal 2: complete an in-depth research report on developing-world aid\n\n\nWe aim to publish an in-depth research report on developing-world aid by\nJune 1, 2009.  The report will include:\n\n    • Activities listings and basic ratings for each of the approximately\n      800 US-registered international-aid charities with annual budgets in\n      excess of $1 million.\n    • At least 10 recommended charities in all, and at least one recommended\n      charity within each of the following areas:\n         o Direct health interventions\n         o Economic empowerment programs (microfinance, agricultural\n           training, irrigation, etc.)\n         o Primary and secondary education (scholarships, school building)\n    • Literature reviews on several general questions about international\n      aid (see http://blog.givewell.net/?p=303)\n    • Detailed notes on two focus regions\n\nWe anticipate devoting half of our time (40 total focused hours per week)\nto research.  We anticipate that our Research Analyst will work 30 total\nfocused hours per week, of which 25 will be devoted to research, and that\nwe will get at least another 5 focused hours per week from volunteers.\n\nCompleting this report will require completing the following tasks.\n\nTask 1: Review literature on the cost-effectiveness of different health\ninterventions; identify priority interventions.\nTime estimate:  Done; took approx. 200 hours of our time and 40 hours of\nvolunteer time.  This estimate includes all discussion, brainstorming, and\nwriting up findings.\n\nTask 2: Review literature on economic empowerment programs and primary and\nsecondary education; identify priority interventions.\nTime estimate: 240 hours (6 weeks) of our time.  We have already looked\npreliminarily at the literature in both of these areas, and believe that\nthere is significantly less to go through in the two combined than in\nhealth.\n\nTask 3: Creating a dataset summarizing the major activities of as many\ninternational aid organizations as possible, including the ~800 in the\ndataset we currently own (see http://www.givewell.net/applicants).\nTime estimate: 400 hours (13.3 weeks) of volunteer/assistant time.  We have\nhad volunteers working on this task at a fairly consistent rate of 30\nminutes per charity.\n\nTask 4: Create ratings of charities by matching up their activities with\nour list of priority interventions.  Use these ratings to identify priority\ncharities.\nTime estimate: 200 hours (5 weeks) of our time; 40 hours (1.3 weeks) of\nvolunteer/assistant time.  We have no sense of how to do this estimate, and\nare assigning it an amount of time comparable to other major tasks.\n\nTask 5: Conduct literature reviews on other questions, including the\ngeneral questions listed at http://blog.givewell.net/?p=303, and any\nliterature review necessary to help choose our two focus regions\nTime estimate: 240 hours (6 weeks) of our time.  As with Task 4, we have no\nsense of how to do this estimate, and are assigning it an amount of time\ncomparable to other major tasks.\n\nTask 6: Complete in-depth reviews of recommended charities.\nTime estimate: assuming 10 recommended charities, each of which takes 20\nhours of volunteer/assistant time and 20 hours of our time (these estimates\nbased partly on our experiences writing such recommendations in Year 1 for\nPIH, PSI, NFP and KIPP), yields an estimate of 200 hours (5 weeks) of our\ntime; 200 hours (6.7 weeks) of volunteer/assistant time.\n\nTask 7: Conduct and write up personal visits to our two focus regions\nTime estimate: 4 weeks of our time (2 weeks each for Holden and Elie)\n\nTask 8: polish final report/fudge factor.\nTime estimate: 200 hours (5 weeks) of our time; 200 hours (6.7 weeks) of\nvolunteer/assistant time.\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n12/22/2008 – literature review of economic empowerment and education\ncompleted.\n\n2/2/2009 – literature review of general aid-related questions completed.\n\n2/11/2009 – dataset summarizing activities of international aid\norganizations completed.\n\n3/9/2009 – ratings completed for each charity; priority charities\nidentified and contacted.  Site visit #1 begins.\n\n3/30/2009 – Site visit #1 completed; site visit #2 begins.\n\n4/13/2009 – Site visit #2 completed.\n\n4/27/2009 – reviews of recommended charities completed.\n\n6/1/2009 – final report released.\n\n\n\n\nGoal 3.  Continue to pursue customers and measure demand.\n\n\nWe feel it is important to continuing pursuing more “customers,” i.e.,\npeople who will use our research for their charitable giving.  We feel this\nway because:\n\n    • Our ability to recruit customers reflects on the viability of our\n      project as a whole.\n    • Getting feedback from customers about where our resource is falling\n      short will help us to focus on the right areas.\n    • Moving more money increases the attractiveness of our project to the\n      current supporters of our operating expenses.\n\nAt this point we do not have a single strategy for pursuing customers that\nwe believe is cost-effective and reliable.  Instead, we have many possible\nstrategies that we are interested in (or in the process of) experimenting\nwith:\n    • Targeting companies in our target sectors (finance, consulting,\n      software).\n         o We have cold-emailed 18 companies that we found through a search\n           of corporate charity-matching programs.\n         o We will follow up with each company once by both email and\n           phone, and assess the results.  We will consider this strategy a\n           success (enough to continue it further) if we get either (a) an\n           opportunity to speak in front of at least 30 people (in a forum\n           that allows us to follow up with attendees and receive their\n           feedback on future research); (b) $10,000 in funds committed to\n           charities found through our research (either GiveWell pledges or\n           donations restricted to grants).\n    • Targeting relatively small family foundations.  We have cold-emailed\n      18 family foundations, and will follow up with each once by email and\n      once by phone and assess the results.  We will consider this strategy\n      a success (enough to continue it further) if we get at least $10,000\n      in funds committed to charities found through our research (either\n      GiveWell pledges or donations restricted to grants).\n    • Presenting our research results more engagingly and more frequently in\n      the hopes of increasing the interest of those on our email list, as\n      well as generating online attention (links from blogs, etc.)\n    • Partnering with major online giving resources such as Guidestar,\n      Charity Navigator, and Network for Good.  We are currently in contact\n      with GuideStar (scheduled to speak next in December), and are planning\n      on continuing to find and contact partners along these lines.\n    • Partnering with donor-advised funds such as those run by Vanguard,\n      Fidelity and Schwab.  We are currently in contact with these three\n      DAFs, and plan on gradually building relationships.\n    • Partnering with private wealth advisors.\n    • Partnering with organizations/people that focus on raising funds for\n      particular causes (or charity in general), as opposed to particular\n      organizations.\n    • Online advertising via platforms such as AdWords, Facebook, and\n      LinkedIn.\n    • Person-to-person networking.\n         o We have invested a high amount of time in this technique without\n           great returns so far; see our Overview of progress and new\n           evidence since 6/19/2008.\n         o We plan to continue following up with extremely promising\n           contacts, particularly those who actively contact us and/or\n           those that may be able to get us in front of large groups.\n         o We plan not to continue spending a significant amount of time\n           pushing for more introductions.\n\nAt this point we do not have a good sense of the expected return on time\nfor any of the following strategies, and as such do not want to commit to a\nspecific deliverable.  Instead, we plan to allocate 10 hours per week to\nexperimenting with these strategies (in the rough order of priority listed)\nand estimate the return on different strategies in terms of the following\nmetrics:\n\n    • Money moved (defined as the to the sum of Clear Fund grants, GiveWell\n      Pledges, and all other donations that are directly attributable to\n      GiveWell’s research).\n    • Money moved through donors who know us only from GiveWell.\n    • Number of donations moved through donors who know us only from\n      GiveWell.\n    • Links from other blogs and websites (taking into consideration the\n      significance, as measured by Alexa and Technorati rank, of these blogs\n      and websites).\n    • Mentions in mainstream media.\n    • Traffic to website and blog.\n    • Subscribers to blog and email list(s).\n    • Partnerships with donor advised funds, wealth advisors, and online\n      donor resources.\n\n\nGoal 4. Pursue important relationships\n\n\nWe seek to build relationships along the following lines\n\n    • Successful supporters to serve as mentors and members of the Board of\n      Directors\n    • Partners who can help us reach potential users of our research\n    • Donors who can increase our money moved and continue to build our\n      network\n    • High-credibility supporters for our Advisory Board\n\nWe currently spend a total of about 15 hours per week on correspondence\n(via email) with current and potential contacts.  We believe that we can\nmaintain this allocation and reach the following deliverables:\n\n    • A total of three experienced entrepreneurs who serve as mentors to us\n      on a regular basis.  (We currently have one.)\n    • A total of five highly credible and/or visible figures who serve on\n      our Advisory Board and endorse our research.  (We currently have two.)\n"

We now feel\nthat our top priority is research, with money moved as a lower priority.\n\n    • We believed that we could raise substantial amounts of money through\n      our network, particularly through high-net-worth donors.  We now\n      believe that this networking approach is too time-intensive, and that\n      the correct target market for us is medium-size donors whom we must\n      reach in more systematic, scalable ways.\n    • We believed that the current state of our research would be sufficient\n      to raise large amounts of money.  We now believe that in order to\n      reach our target market in a large-scale way, we need substantially\n      broader and deeper research.\n    • We believed that we had no way to create a substantially broader and\n      deeper set of research without extreme growth in staff.  We now\n      believe that a deep, broad resource can be built within a few years,\n      while scaling up from our current expenses to no more than $1.6\n      million per year.\n    • We believed that raising money through our network was the key to\n      “proving” demand and thereby raising more operating funds and drawing\n      more media exposure.  We now believe that investors – including us –\n      are unlikely to see money raised through our network as proof of\n      demand.  Instead, we must make progress toward a long-term goal of\n      moving money at scale.\n    • We believed that we could, and needed to, “prove” significant demand\n      in the short term.  We now believe that we can show incremental\n      progress on demand as we continue our research, but the full state of\n      demand for it can only be assessed once our research content is\n      substantially improved.\n\nThe rest of this document lays out the supporting evidence for the above\nsummary.\n\nHow our view has changed     2\nWho is our target market?    2\nHow can we reach our target market?     3\nWhat would it take to do substantially broader and deeper research? 3\nHow can we demonstrate the project’s viability and scalability to\ninvestors?  3\nWhat is our long-term, steady-state vision, both in terms of research\ncoverage and sources of money moved?    5\nConclusion  5\nNotes on the pitches we’ve given to date     5\n      High net worth individuals   5\n      Referrals   6\n      People who submitted our feedback survey     6\n      People who found us    7\n      Friends and former coworkers 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow our view has changed\n\n\nOn 6/19/2008, we published our plan for GiveWell Year 2.  The centerpiece\nof this plan was a focus on increasing the money moved by GiveWell:[1]\n\n      Goal 1  [increasing  our  money  moved]  not  only  answers  the  most\n      important current question  about  GiveWell  –  the  question  of  how\n      influential or model can be – but also is important  in  pursuing  all\n      three of our other goals, since our ability to move money will  affect\n      the likelihood that charities  share  information  with  us  and  that\n      qualified people collaborate with us.  It is  important  to  recognize\n      that this goal – increasing our “money moved” – is  by  far  the  most\n      important one for this year.  If and only if we make good progress  on\n      it, we will be much better positioned to accomplish our other goals  …\n      in future years.\n\nWe now feel differently.  As outlined in our more recent tactical document,\nwe believe that our top priority is further improving our research model,\nto the point where we can create a resource that is both broad and deep in\nits coverage of philanthropic options.\n\nThis document lays out the new evidence and ideas since 6/19/2008, and why\nour view has changed.\n\n\nWho is our target market?\n\n\nIn our previous plan, we wrote:\n\n      Without a strong brand or large advertising budget, we don’t see an\n      immediate path to reaching and influencing individual donors en masse.\n       We believe our best short-run strategy for increasing our influence\n      is to target major individual donors, whom we can reach and interact\n      with through personal relationships.\n\n\nWe did not distinguish between donors of different ages or sizes (beyond\nfocusing on “major” donors).\n\nSince then, we have had 78 total “pitch meetings,” in which we argued the\ncase for a GiveWell Pledge to one or more people.  The results are\nsummarized at the bottom of this document; one of the key findings is that\ngoing after high-net-worth individuals has been extremely unproductive.\n\nWe believe that a given donor is much more likely to be a customer when\ns/he is not already highly involved in philanthropy, but is instead looking\nfor a way to make an impact with relatively small donations and relatively\nlittle involvement.  Such customers are more similar to the original\nmembers of our 8-person project (before it went full-time) and of our\noriginal funders.\n\n\nHow can we reach our target market?\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed above, we initially planned to focus on person-to-person\nnetworking in order to increase our “money moved.”\n\nWe now believe that if we are to move a significant amount of money, we\nmust do so with scale – not simply via person-to-person networking.\n\nA large part of this belief is the relatively low return on investment from\nthe pledge-raising we’ve done so far.  In our view, a reasonable return on\ninvestment would be one that would make it possible to move 9x as much\nmoney as our current operating costs (thus reducing our “operating expense\nratio” to 10%) within a year, by spending half our time (40 hours per week)\non marketing.  Such an endeavor would require a return on investment over\n$700 per hour; the only pledge-raising that has come close to this level is\npledge-raising from those who already know us or who specifically sought us\nout via the web.  See the bottom of this document for details.\n\nInstead, we seek ways to reach large numbers of people in our target\nmarket.  Our vision document lays out several methods for doing so.\nHowever, we feel that nearly every such method would be substantially more\nviable if our research were substantially more comprehensive.\n\n\nWhat would it take to do substantially broader and deeper research?\n\n\n\n\nWhen we published our previous plan, we were still in the final stages of\nour year-1 research, which was conducted using a “bottom-up” approach:\ngetting nearly all of our information from charities’ grant applications.\nWe saw this intensive process as something that would have to be repeated\neach year, in full, for each cause we covered.  We therefore anticipated\nthat we would need an extremely large staff to cover a broad array of\ncauses.\n\nSince then, we have focused more on a “top-down” approach, identifying\npromising programs and collecting as much background information as\npossible, and aiming to involve charities only at the final step (checking\nadherence to a proven program).  We now believe that much of the necessary\nresearch for a given cause does not need to be performed nearly as\nfrequently as once per year.\n\nAs expressed in our vision document, we now believe we can create a broad\nand deep resource within a few years, and without excessive annual expenses\n(even the large-scale organization in our vision document has expenses in\nthe range of $1.6 million per year, only about twice the budget of Charity\nNavigator).\n\n\nHow can we demonstrate the project’s viability and scalability to\ninvestors?\n\n\nOur previous plan emphasized the importance of raising GiveWell Pledges as\na way to “demonstrate” demand for our research.\n\nWe believed that demonstrating demand would improve our ability to raise\nmoney from “investors,” i.e., people who pay our operating expenses in the\nhopes that we can grow our project and have a significant impact on\nphilanthropy.  The two co-Founders also wanted to see GiveWell Pledges as\nevidence of demand, relevant to our own investment (of our labor) in the\nproject.\n\nAs discussed above, we now have a new picture of our target audience and\nhow it can be reached – one that stresses the importance of improving our\nresearch before focusing on marketing.\n\nIn addition, in speaking to high-net-worth individuals and foundations –\npotential investors – the most common concern we’ve heard (by far) has been\nthe question of how we will take our project to scale: provide broad enough\nresearch coverage (causes and charities) and reach enough donors to have a\nsignificant impact on philanthropy.\n\nSuch investors have not seen our ability to raise money directly from our\nnetwork, in the range of $500,000 (our previous target for this year), as\nan indicator of our ability to take the project to scale, or of demand in\ngeneral.  They instead were most interested in seeing that we had a\nsystematic way of a) conducting our research and recommending charities\n(one that does not rely solely on Elie’s and Holden’s judgment) and b) a\nsystematic, repeatable method for reaching our target market. After much\ndiscussion and reflection, we agree with them.\n\nExamples of these conversations:\n\n  Information on specific individuals withheld from public version of this\n                                  document\n\n   1. V.C. said specifically that he wouldn’t care at all if we could raise\n      $500,000 from our network. He was much more interested in seeing that\n      we had a method for consistently raising funds.\n   2. High-net worth individual questioned the scalability of our research\n      and the degree to which GiveWell relies on Elie and Holden,\n      specifically.\n   3. Foundation officer most wants to see a systematic way of reaching\n      donors and conducting our research.\n   4. Foundation officer II is more interested in research coverage than\n      “money moved.”\n\nAs we can, we plan to speak to potential investors about what they would\nlike to see from us to continue funding so we know what we need to deliver.\n\nWe no longer believe that raising GiveWell Pledges from our network will\nlead to the kind of “evidence of demand” that will allow us to raise\nsignificantly more operating funds, or that will give us substantially more\nconfidence in our ability to reach our long-term vision.\n\nInstead, in considering how to improve the case for our project to\ninvestors (including ourselves), we have focused on the end goal, how we\ncan get there, and what indicators we can aim to measure along the way.\nSee immediately below.\n\n\nWhat is our long-term, steady-state vision, both in terms of research\ncoverage and sources of money moved?\n\n\n\n\nOur conversations with investors (see immediately above) pushed us to think\nharder about our long-term vision for GiveWell:\n\n      • The depth and breadth of research we need to move a significant\n        amount of money.\n      • The hoped-for eventual sources of “money moved.”\n\nThis long-term vision is something that we hadn’t thought about hard enough\nor specifically enough before.  We have now outlined it in our vision\ndocument, and we see progress on research as the most promising short-term\ngoal on the path to this vision.  The reasons for this view are laid out in\nour tactical plan; in a nutshell, we feel that most eventual sources of\nmoney moved will be much easier to partner with when we have a longer track\nrecord and more depth and breadth of research.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n    • We no longer see GiveWell Pledges, raised through networking, as a\n      good general indicator of demand for our research.\n    • We believe that in order to reach our target market effectively and at\n      scale, we will need substantially more (deeper, broader) research than\n      we currently have.\n    • We no longer believe that our research need be extremely expensive on\n      a per-cause basis.  We believe that we can reach a strong level of\n      depth and breadth for a few million dollars over a few years.\n    • We therefore believe the best path toward our long-term vision begins\n      with improving our research, rather than trying to establish demand\n      for the limited product we offer now.\n\n\nNotes on the pitches we’ve given to date\n\n\n\nHigh net worth individuals\n\n\nThrough referrals, we’ve spoken to 13 individuals that we perceive as\nhaving very large charitable budgets (in excess of $100,000 per year).\n\n    • 12 out of 13 declined to make a GiveWell pledge. The 1 that did each\n      made a relatively small pledge ($10,000, conditional on our raising\n      $240,000 in pledges from others).  Of those that declined:\n         o 7 cited their own ability to find charities they could have\n           confidence in, often through personal connections\n         o 2 had strong doubts about our research model and ability to find\n           better organizations for them to support\n         o 1 cited recent losses in the stock market as forcing him to\n           curtail giving\n         o 1 stated that he has committed his entire budget for the year\n           (though he plans to review our research and consider a pledge\n           for next year)\n         o 1 was uninterested in “charity” (preferring instead Kiva or an X-\n           Prize type vehicle).\n    • The 1 that agreed to pledge had supported us in our first year.\n\nTime cost (including time spent on getting referrals, following up, etc.):\n50-100 man-hours in addition to our week in California.\n\nReturn on investment (backward-looking): below $200/hr.\n\n\nReferrals\n\n\nWe went to 35 of our friends and former coworkers and asked them to refer\nus directly to people who might be interested in pledging. This process\nyielded 21 prospects. Of those;\n\n    • 4 agreed to pledge (1x$5,000, 2x$1,000, and 1 without yet giving an\n      amount)\n    • 6 reacted positively but have yet to make a final decision\n    • 6 did not want to pledge (3 said they were already happy with their\n      charities of choice, 1 said recent market conditions means they\n      likely won’t give this year, and 1 said he had recently left his job,\n      and 1 gave no reason)\n    • 5 we have yet to reach\n\nTime cost: ~75 hours.\n\nReturn on investment: the 3 quantified pledges we have total $7,000.\nAssuming that the 7 who have yet to provide an amount pledge at the same\nrate would yield an (optimistic) estimate of $23,000, or about $300/hr.\n\n\nPeople who submitted our feedback survey\n\n\nWe contacted 20 people who submitted a feedback survey through\ngivewell.net, indicating (a) a charitable budget of $100,000+ per year or\n(b) both a charitable budget of $5,000+ per year and an interest in\ndeveloping-world aid. Of those:\n\n    • 3 agreed to pledge (2x$2,500 and 1x250)\n    • 3 did not want to pledge  - 1 spoke with us on the phone by said he’s\n      not giving to charity right now; 2 responded to our intial email\n      saying they weren’t interested.\n    • 14 never responded to our initial email\n\nTime cost: 5-10 hours\n\nReturn on investment: $500-1000/hr.\n\n\nPeople who found us\n\n\nWe have made some contacts who actively found us and expressed an interest\nin supporting the project (not just submitting the feedback survey).\nGetting to the point of a yes/no on a GiveWell Pledge (or donation) often\ntook multiple follow-ups, but led to good results:\n\n    • 2 pledges for $25,000 each\n    • 1 donation of $18,000\n    • 2 pledges for $10,000 each\n    • 1 pledge for $5,000\n    • 3 pledges of $2,000-$2,500 each\n    • 1 pledge of $500\n    • 2 pledges of (as yet) unspecified amounts\n\nTime cost: 20 total hours.\n\nReturn on investment: ~$5,000/hr.\n\n\nFriends and former coworkers\n\n\nWe pitched 33 people who are our own friends and former coworkers. The\ntable below separates those people by result (Yes, No, still pending) and\nwhether they supported GiveWell in year 1.  Note that most of those who\nhave agreed to make a GiveWell Pledge have not yet specified an amount.\n\n           [pic]\n\nThe 2 who said “No” cited financial concerns (1 due to a recent job change\nand 1 due to the financial crisis).\n\nAmong those who are new supporters, we raised $26,000 from 9 people. One\nperson has yet to give an amount for their pledge.\n\nTime cost: ~50 hours.\n\n\n-----------------------\n[1] “Money moved” refers to the sum of Clear Fund grants, GiveWell Pledges,\nand all other donations that are directly attributable to GiveWell’s\nresearch.\n\n"

Discussion of professional development plan.  Allow 30 minutes.  See\n      Attachment A.\n\n         • Staff proposes to establish formal mentoring relationships with\n           particular contacts (people whom we both have access to and have\n           substantial experience in business, particularly with creating a\n           successful startup).\n         • These contacts will receive and discuss each biweekly report.\n         • We currently have two such mentors and are planning on\n           soliciting more from among our current contacts; we aim to have\n           four such mentors by June of 2009.\n         • We also plan to pursue other options including a social\n           entrepreneurship group at the Harvard Club and several\n           competitive programs for social entrepreneurs.  However, the\n           heart of our professional development plan is mentoring\n           relationships.\n\n   3. Discussion of long-term vision for GiveWell.  Allow 45 minutes.  See\n      Attachment B.  GiveWell aims to reach the following “steady state”:\n\n      • Depth, breadth, and presentation of research: GiveWell publishes up-\n        to-date research on seven broad causes: developing-world aid,\n        disease research, global warming prevention/mitigation, equality of\n        opportunity in the U.S., mitigation of suffering in the U.S.,\n        tolerance in the U.S., and animal welfare.  It recommends several\n        charities per cause (including one for each subcause, outlined in\n        the body of our vision document) and provides basic ratings for\n        much larger numbers of charities.\n      • Capacity and operating funding: GiveWell has a staff of about\n        twenty, and operates on about $1.7 million per year.  Its staff is\n        sufficient to provide broad, deep research as well as maintaining\n        an excellent website and active marketing efforts.\n      • Money moved: GiveWell affects a large amount of money – at least\n        $15 million, 9 times operating costs – through a variety of methods\n        outlined in the body of this document.\n      • High-credibility/high-visibility supporters: GiveWell will have a\n        10-person Board of Directors, composed primarily of major donors\n        who are successful and well-connected in the for-profit world.  It\n        will also maintain a separate Advisory Board for each broad cause\n        covered by its research, composed of 3-10 people with significant\n        expertise in that particular area.\n      • Brand value / name recognition:  GiveWell will occupy a place in\n        annual coverage of giving similar to that currently occupied by\n        Charity Navigator.  It will be covered in multiple mainstream media\n        pieces during giving season of each year.  Its research will be\n        frequently referenced and linked to in online blog posts and\n        discussions of relevant issues.\n\n   4. Discussion of revised tactical plan for progressing toward our vision.\n       Allow 45 minutes.  See Attachment C for our tactical plan and\n      Attachment D for the reasons behind our change in direction from the\n      plan outlined at the last Board meeting.\n\n      • Priority 1: hire a research analyst in order to improve our ability\n        to accomplish our other goals (below).  5 hours per week.\n      • Priority 2: Complete an in-depth research report on developing-\n        world aid, while systemizing as much as possible of the research\n        process.  40 hours per week.\n      • Priority 3: Continue to pursue customers in order to a) measure\n        demand and b) get substantive feedback on the materials we produce.\n         10 hours per week.\n      • Priority 4: Pursue important relationships.  15 hours per week.\n            o Successful supporters to serve as mentors and members of the\n              Board of Directors\n            o Partners who can help us reach potential users of our\n              research\n            o Donors who can increase our money moved and continue to build\n              our network\n            o High-credibility supporters for our Advisory Board\n\nTotal projected meeting time: 2 hours\nNext meeting: January 2009\n\nAttachments:\n   A. Professional development plan\n   B. Vision document.\n   C.

          "text": "\n                  Research: Key Questions as of 12/15/2008\n\n   1. What do we want/need to have in the research report we produce?\n        a. A general overview of international aid (academic literature)\n        b. Identification of “top” charities.\n        c. Thorough evaluations of “top” charities.\n        d. Evaluations and/or cataloguing of a broad range of charities.\n   2. What goals are important?  (Answer will heavily affect answer to #1)\n        a. Generating  charity  recommendations  for  core  supporters  and\n           GiveWell Pledgers, to help  them  accomplish  as  much  good  as\n           possible.\n        b. Increasing our appeal to more casual potential customers (people\n           who encounter us through friends, media, etc.)  These people are\n           often more concerned with breadth of coverage and  less  focused\n           on “just the top charities.”\n        c. Increasing our appeal to donor-advised funds,  wealth  advisors,\n           etc.  It’s somewhat hard to say  exactly  what  they’re  looking\n           for.\n        d. Increasing our appeal  to  online  donor  resources  (GuideStar,\n           Charity Navigator).  For these, the most important aspect of our\n           research is probably the number of charities covered/rated.\n   3. How will we evaluate our progress?\n\n                       More Detail: Goals of Research\n\n   1. Provide  a  general  overview  of  international  aid:  the  potential\n      benefits,  potential  downsides,  major  success  stories  /   failure\n      stories, etc.\n\nWhat the work consists of: Finding and  reading  academic  works;  following\nreferences to other works; summarizing what we find.\n\nTime cost: Probably on the order of  4-8  weeks.   Time  estimates  in  this\ndocument refer to how long it would take  GiveWell  to  complete  this  task\nwith Holden and Elie both focused on it for 100% of  their  “research  time”\n(50% of overall time).\n\nProgress indicators: this work should translate into interesting blog  posts\nat a fairly regular clip.\n\nPotential support:\n\n    • Very unlikely that an “analyst” (the type of person we’ve been looking\n      to hire for $35/yr) could add value here.\n    • Some potential in offering compensation to graduate students for well-\n      done literature reviews.\n    • Well-directed conversations with academic experts  (grad  students  if\n      necessary; major figures if possible) could be extremely helpful.\n\nOther notes:\n\n    • We’ve had trouble finding useful papers on these topic so far.   We’ve\n      mostly  found   (a)   general/qualitative/”popular”   overviews;   (b)\n      econometric analysis that we  don’t  feel  provides  the  context  and\n      perspective necessary for common-sense evaluation.  We’re looking  for\n      work that better combines facts (not  just  claims)  with  painting  a\n      picture (not just building and running a model).\n    • We are going to need better library access than what we have.\n\n\n   2. Identify “top” charities: charities that are focused on  interventions\n      with impressive track records.\n\nWhat the work consists of:\n\n    • Identifying the interventions that academic literature considers to be\n      (a) “success stories”; (b) promising  programs  for  the  future;  (c)\n      highly cost-effective (by a variety of different measures of “value”).\n    • Finding charities that focus on these programs.\n         o Having a “charity database” (discussed below)  would  make  this\n           step fairly easy.\n         o Without one, we would rely largely on referrals and Google.\n    • Basic (but not thorough) due diligence on these charities.\n\nTime cost: Relatively minimal once we identify top interventions, which  can\nlikely be accomplished as part  of  Goal  1.   (We  already  have  a  fairly\nsubstantial  list  of  top  interventions  from  our  work  to  date  –  see\nhttp://www.givewell.net/research-agenda)\n\nProgress indicators: we should be able to identify the charities working  on\na given intervention at a rate of 1-2 days per intervention.\n\nOther notes:\n\n    • There’s a question of how much sense it makes to give to a large multi-\n      purpose organization (such as UNICEF) while restricting  the  donation\n      to a particular program.\n\n   3. Evaluate “top” charities: thoroughly examine their documents  to  form\n      detailed, high-confidence recommendations.\n\nWhat the work consists of: Contacting  “top  charities”  and  requesting  as\nmuch of their documentation as possible;  asking  them  specific  questions;\nanalyzing the  documentation  and  creating  writeups  similar  to  what  we\ncreated in Year 1.\n\nTime cost: ~1 week per charity.\n\nProgress indicators: 1 thorough charity writeup per week spent.\n\nPotential support:\n    • An “analyst” could add limited value.\n    • Academics unlikely to be helpful except tangentially.\n\n   4. Evaluate  (or  at  least  catalogue)  a  comprehensive  set  of  major\n      charities.\n\nWhat the work consists of:\n    • The primary goal is to catalogue the activities of as  many  charities\n      as possible.\n         o The main source for this  information  is  charities’  websites.\n           These usually  include  descriptions  of  activities  in  enough\n           detail to get some idea of what they’re doing, though  vagueness\n           is common.\n         o We may also be able to get information from major  funders  such\n           as USAID, CIDA, DFID, the Gates Foundation, etc.\n    • Doing so would contribute to the goal of naming “top charities.”\n    • It may also be possible to rate individual  charities  based  on  what\n      activities they carry out, what academic literature says  about  these\n      activities, and  how  much  of  this  information  is  available  from\n      charities’ websites.\n    • This project can be done at different levels of detail:\n         o Evaluating only “household-name” charities (Red  Cross;  UNICEF;\n           CARE; Save the Children; etc.)\n         o Evaluating all US-registered public charities  above  a  certain\n           size (and possibly with other restrictions, such as being listed\n           by Charity Navigator).   There  are  ~800  such  charities  with\n           annual expenses over $1 million;  ~200  are  listed  by  Charity\n           Navigator.\n\nTime cost: Substantial and hard to estimate at this point.  Depends  heavily\non implementation  of  this  project.   Also  has  far  more  potential  for\nsystemization/support than any of the other goals.\n    • Extremely diverse charities can take upwards of a day to catalogue.\n    • Moderately large ones can take several hours.\n    • Fairly simple charities can be catalogued in 30-60 minutes.\n    • After cataloguing the charity, there is also the question of using its\n      activities to create an evaluation of it.  This too  can  be  done  at\n      different levels of thoroughness.\n    • The highest level of thoroughness (matching each activity to what  the\n      academic  literature  says  about  it)  will  require  creation  of  a\n      “programs database” as well as a “charities database.”  We may be able\n      to create such a database in a few weeks, or it may  turn  out  to  be\n      infeasible.\n\nProgress indicators: this work would  initially  focus  on  extremely  large\ncharities, and should produce at least one charity evaluation per week.   As\nwe gain in our ability to  systemize  the  work,  and  move  on  to  smaller\ncharities, we should speed up considerably.\n\nPotential support:\n    • An “analyst”  could  add  value  both  in  cataloguing  charities  and\n      cataloguing programs.\n    • Academics unlikely to be helpful.\n    • Contacts at major funders might be helpful, as mentioned above.\n\n\n                           More Detail: Customers\n\n\n   1. Core supporters and GiveWell Pledgers.   We  see  these  customers  as\n      primarily being interested in recommendations.  Goal  #2  (identifying\n      top charities) seems most important; #1 (general review of literature)\n      and #3 (thoroughly evaluating top charities) may be as well.\n   2. People with more casual interest –  those  who  encounter  us  through\n      friends, the media, etc.  We believe that we often lose  these  people\n      at the point where we can’t provide any information  on  a  particular\n      charity.\n   3. DAFs,  wealth  advisors,  etc.   Hard  to  say  exactly  what  they’re\n      interested in.  In theory, any compelling set of recommendations could\n      be  useful  to  them,  but  we  believe  that   having   comprehensive\n      evaluations could add much-needed credibility to our recommendations.\n   4. Online donor  resources:  GuideStar,  Charity  Navigator.   Both  have\n      expressed at least preliminary openness to partnering with us.  We see\n      both  as  being  primarily  interested  in   coverage   of   as   many\n      organizations as possible.\n"

          "text": "\n                   Proposal to open two new bank accounts\n\nProposal\n\n    • Invest $245,000 in a 2.3% money market account at Corus Bank.\n    • Invest $245,000 in a 2.25% money market account at CalFirst Bank.\n    • Keep the remaining ~$210,000 at  our  current  bank,  TD  Bank,  split\n      between our no-interest checking account and our money-market account,\n      which pays 1.5%.  We would keep approximately $50,000 in  checking  so\n      that we can promptly pay salary and anything else that comes up.\n\nWe seek approval of corporate resolutions for Corus, CalFirst, and  EverBank\n(EverBank is a backup in case there are any unanticipated  issues  with  one\nof the first two).  We are using the template provided for  Corus  Bank  for\nall three; the only difference between the 3 resolutions in Attachment D  is\nthe name of the bank.\n\nFDIC pages for these three banks:\n    •                                Corus                                 -\n      http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/confirmation_outside.asp?inCert1=13693\n    •                               CalFirst                               -\n      http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/confirmation_outside.asp?inCert1=35331\n    •                               EverBank                               -\n      http://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/confirmation_outside.asp?inCert1=34775\n\nRationale\n\nAs of 3/27/09, The Clear Fund holds a total of $697,728.73 in cash.\n\n(This does not include an additional $35,000 held in our Donor Advised  Fund\nthrough the Vanguard Charitable Endowment Program.)\n\nOpening new bank accounts will bring two benefits:\n\n    • More security through FDIC  insurance.   FDIC  insurance  covers  only\n      $250,000 of the cash we hold at a given financial institution.[1]   By\n      opening two new accounts of  slightly  under  $250,000  each,  we  can\n      ensure that all of our assets are FDIC insured.\n    • More favorable interest rates.  As discussed below, other banks  offer\n      around 0.9% higher interest rates than our current bank.   By  opening\n      two new accounts of slightly under  $250,000  each,  we  can  earn  an\n      additional ~$4500/yr in interest.\n\nHow the bank accounts were selected\n\nTime frame considerations\n\n$344,379.00 is earmarked to be regranted to top  charities.   (In  addition,\nall of the $35,000.00 we hold in our Donor Advised Fund will be  regranted.)\n We are aiming to complete our research report by  July  1  and  make  these\ngrants shortly afterward.\n\nOur total monthly expenses are approximately $20,000-$30,000  per  month  as\noutlined in our “budget projections” spreadsheet.\n\nTherefore, we see our liquidity requirements as follows:\n\n                                    [pic]\n\nBest interest rates (APY) for different time periods as of 3/27/09\n\nSee bottom of this document for how these rates were found.\n\nLiquid (money market or savings): 2.3% (Corus Bank); 2.1% (CalFirst);  2.03%\n(Everbank)\n\n3mo: highest Certificate of Deposit rate is  substantially  lower  than  the\nliquid rates cited above.\n\n6mo: 2.32% (Corus Bank)\n\n12mo: 2.81% (Corus Bank)\n\nThe proposal at the top of this document represents the  minimum  number  of\nnew accounts we can open to become fully FDIC insured.  This  setup  fulfils\nour timeframe requirements.  We will have  to  rebalance  in  6  months,  at\nwhich point our balances will be close to the $250,000 FDIC limit.\n\nAssuming constant interest  rates,  over  the  next  12mo  we  project  this\nallocation to net ~$1900 more in interest than keeping all our funds  at  TD\nbank would, and ~$900 less than we would gain by  splitting  our  funds  for\nthe maximum possible interest (which would require opening 3 rather  than  2\nnew bank accounts, and locking up much of  our  assets  in  certificates  of\ndeposit).\n\nAddendum: how we searched for top interest rates\n\nI used Bankrate.com to identify the highest interest  rates  for  3mo,  6mo,\nand 12mo Certificates of Deposit.\n\nFinding interest rates for liquid accounts (savings, money market) was  more\ndifficult because Bankrate.com searches only for  personal,  not  corporate,\naccounts.  Many of the banks that offer high personal savings rates  do  not\noffer corporate accounts, or offer  corporate  accounts  with  substantially\nlower interest rates.\n\nI examined the websites of the 16 top banks under a Bankrate.com search  for\npersonal savings/money market accounts.  (There was  a  steep  rate  dropoff\nafter 16.)  Most have no corporate option or have corporate rates  that  are\nsubstantially lower than the options listed.\n-----------------------\n[1] See http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/insured/faq.html Question 11\n\n"

Get public feedback from people with relevant experience/knowledge,\n      which we will post linked from our report\n   2. In-depth charity reviews. Reviews similar to PSI, PIH, and The Carter\n      Center for ~5 more charities.\n   3. Info on other charities/programs for context:\n         o Brief (1-page) write-ups of 3-5 \"household name\" charities\n           (e.g., UNICEF, CARE, Save the Children)\n         o Reports on the evidence of effectiveness for \"popular programs\"\n           (e.g., microfinance, anti-retroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS, water\n           and sanitation programs)\n         o Financial analysis of charities to assess what \"normal\" levels\n           our for our financial indicators (see\n           http://givewell.net/node/351)\n\nTiming\n\n\nWe propose to:\n\n    • Complete a report by 7/1/09 that includes the components above\n    • Allocate no more than 20% of our research/packaging hours to packaging\n      (i.e., when we have usable feedback re: packaging, do up to 10\n      hours/week of work on it)\n\nThe rest of this document provides our estimates for the time each\ncomponent will take.\n\n\n\nReasoning behind proposal\n\n\n\nKey dates\n\n\n7/1/2009 – we previously told GiveWell Pledgers we would have recommended\ncharities available by this date.  We have ~650 research/packaging hours\nbefore this date hits.\n\n11/26/2009 – we consider Thanksgiving to be the start of heavy media\ncoverage of giving.  We should aim to have a highly engaging website at\nthat point.  We have missed the Thanksgiving deadline by a couple of weeks\nin the past and still gotten big benefits from giving season.  We have\n~1100 research/packaging hours between 7/1/09 and 11/26/09.\n\nHours estimates do not account for vacation days but also do not account\nfor \"overdrive\" periods.\n\n\nHours available\n\n\nWe estimate that we have 650 hours available between now and 7/1; another\n1100 between 7/1 and Thanksgiving.  These hours are the total available for\nresearch (finding and writing up information) plus packaging (figuring out\nways to present information in a more usable/engaging way). This is based\non an estimate of 50 combined hours per week from Elie and Holden (30 for\nElie; 20 for Holden) for our \"primary\" projects, which relies on our past\ntime allocation.\n\nAgain, this is a conservative estimate.\n\n\nPossible time allocations\n\n\n\"Full research report\" means all components listed above.  \"Partial\nresearch report\" means slimming down everything that isn't directly\nrelevant to charity reviews – somehow cutting the total allocation to\ngeneral issues/feedback/context from 300 hours (implied above) to 100.\n\n   1. 50% allocation to packaging\n        a. Full research report would not be feasible\n        b. Partial research report with 2-3 total charity reviews\n   2. 20% allocation to packaging\n        a. Full research report with 2-4 total charity reviews\n        b. Partial research report with 3-5 total charity reviews\n   3. 10% allocation to packaging (save it for post-7/1 and/or delegate to\n      employee(s))\n        a.

Discussion of general issues (estimated time cost: 110 hours)\n\n\n\n\nPresents information on a variety of questions such as \"What are big\nsuccess/failure stories in aid?\"\n\nNot directly relevant to a particular charity, but could be important for\ndriving home the reasoning behind our approach (in the same way as the\n\"headlines\" currently on our front page).\n\nAlready completed:\n    • Reviewed a large amount of literature on aid in general: what's\n      worked, what hasn't, what the major debates are.  Details at\n      http://www.givewell.net/wiki/index.php?title=DWDA_reading_list\n    • Completed four preliminary writeups on our blog:\n         o Aid's track record.  Health initiatives account for most success\n           stories; studies of aid's effect on GDP growth haven't\n           established a large effect or clear patterns in when aid works.\n           Full post: http://blog.givewell.net/?p=344\n         o Root causes of poverty.  There are many theories of how we can\n           help developing countries \"take off,\" but nearly everyone agrees\n           that past takeoffs have been highly varied and that there is no\n           clear/simple path to \"solving the root causes of poverty.\"  Full\n           post: http://blog.givewell.net/?p=345\n         o Measurement is not as common as it should be.  Why?\n           Demonstrates a very broad consensus among development experts\n           that not enough measurement is happening; cites one as claiming\n           that the problem is lack of proper incentives.  Full post:\n           http://blog.givewell.net/?p=353\n         o Can the Green Revolution be repeated in Africa?  Examines the\n           idea that the reason no \"Green Revolution\" (extreme improvement\n           in agricultural productivity, leading to strong growth and\n           poverty reduction) has taken place in Africa is that\n           philanthropic investment there has not been commensurate with\n           investment in the rest of the world.  Argues against this idea.\n           Full post: http://blog.givewell.net/?p=354\n\nTo do:\n\n    • Finish reviewing literature (~10 hours).  This may also help with\n      finding particularly promising programs (under Component 2).\n    • Writeups on the following major issues (~20 hours each):\n         o Success and failure stories.  Go in-depth on a couple of vivid\n           success & failure stories in aid.  Both should serve to\n           illustrate the importance of monitoring & evaluation (success\n           stories because measurement was often an important part of the\n           program; failure stories because they illustrate the risks of\n           poorly evaluated programs)\n         o Burden of disease and other problems.  Discussion of what\n           diseases afflict the very poor, with what frequency, and also\n           how their living standards are otherwise (to the extent we can\n           generalize, which is limited).  To give a picture of \"what you\n           save when you save a life.\"\n         o Meaning of cost-effectiveness estimates.  Discusses the\n           limitations of cost-effectiveness analysis; shoots down a couple\n           commonly cited \"5c to save a life\" type figures; compares a\n           couple estimates from our main source (Disease Control\n           Priorities report) to independent estimates to support the idea\n           that the report is relatively reliable.\n    • Writeups on the following issues (~5 hours each):\n         o Possible harms of aid.  Lists and gives relevant references for\n           a variety of ways in which aid can be net harmful.\n         o Programs that can/should be scaled up.  Lists proven life-\n           changing programs that, according to various sources, are not\n           \"fully funded\" (ie, there is room to expand them further and\n           reach more people).\n         o Aid to governments vs. donations to nonprofits.  Discusses pros\n           and cons of the two different approaches to aid, ways in which\n           aid literature (which focuses on government aid) may not apply\n           to donors, and discusses how little is known about aid to\n           nonprofits in general.\n         o What does it mean to restrict a donation?  General discussion of\n           the not-often-discussed drawbacks of restricting a donation to a\n           particular program.\n         o Context on current and past aid flows: presents what we know\n           about where current/past aid goes and how much of it there is.\n    • Revising/polishing writeups (2 hours each)\n\n\nComponent 2. Actively pursuing feedback (estimated time cost: 40 hours\nremaining, though could be substantially less)\n\n\nThe goal is to get public feedback on our report from people with relevant\nknowledge & experience, to improve both quality & credibility of the report\nas a whole.\n\nFalls into two main categories: (1) feedback from highly visible, respected\nscholars, who likely won't have time to read our reports in depth but may\ngive general interviews; (2) more engaged feedback from grad students, NPO\nemployees, and other people who have relevant experience.\n\nAlready completed:\n\n    • Category (1) (feedback from highly visible, respected scholars) is\n      within reach without too much more work.\n         o We completed interviews with the following people and need to\n           get their signoff on our notes so we can publish them.\n               ▪ Rachel Glennerster, a Director of the Poverty Action Lab\n               ▪ Prabat Jha, a lead author on the Disease Control\n                 Priorities Project.\n               ▪ Diane Bennett and Laura Freschi, the Executive Director\n                 and Associate Director of the Development Research\n                 Institute (William Easterly's current institution).\n         o We're trying to set up talks with several other prominent\n           scholars including William Easterly and Ruth Levine.\n    • Some progress on category (2) (more engaged feedback from people with\n      relevant experience/knowledge).\n         o One person with a fairly strong resume has been actively talking\n           with us for a while.  Another just had two conversations with us\n           and allowed us to record them.\n         o We have a list of several more who are planning to speak with\n           us, and may do more active recruiting via grad student email\n           lists.\n\nTo do:\n\n    • Category (1) (feedback from highly visible, respected scholars):\n      mostly scheduling conversations with people.  If a lot of people end\n      up not talking to us, we may have to put more effort into finding\n      experts who can answer particular questions we still have.\n    • Category (2) (more engaged feedback from people with relevant\n      experience/knowledge): largely depends on how many people (and what\n      mix of backgrounds) we think is \"sufficient.\"\n\nComponent 3.  Reviews of strong charities and the programs they run (time\ncost estimate: 30 hours remaining for \"charity scan\" + 100-150 hours per\nthoroughly reviewed charity)\n\nAlready completed:\n\n    • Review of The Carter Center.\n    • 2007-2008 reviews of Population Services International and Partners in\n      Health.  Updating for 2008-2009 would largely be a matter of changing\n      the format rather than gathering information.\n    • 8 finalized program reports (see http://www.givewell.net/node/336).\n\nTo do:\n\n    • \"Charity scan\" project to identify promising charities (for further\n      evaluation) by scanning websites.  Time cost very hard to estimate –\n      current estimate is 50 hours from here.\n    • Go through promising charities' materials and complete reviews on\n      them.  Estimated at 50-100 hours per charity based on the Carter\n      Center writeup.\n    • Take the programs featured by promising charities and produce program\n      reports on them.  ~10 hours each; hard to know in advance how many of\n      these we'll need.\n\n\n\nComponent 4.  Discussions of non-recommended charities and programs to give\ncontext (estimated time cost 110 hours)\n\nThere are certain charities (Doctors without Borders, UNICEF, Heifer\nInternational) and programs (AIDS drug therapy, microfinance, water &\nsanitation, comprehensive health programs) that everyone wants to know\nabout.  Discussing them could help our credibility and persuasiveness even\nif it isn't directly relevant to our top charities.\n\nAlready done: gathered information & got a general sense of several large\norganizations and well-known programs, but a long way from having them\nwritten up.\n\nTo do:\n    • Writeups on widely discussed program types (AIDS drug therapy,\n      microfinance, water & sanitation, comprehensive health programs).\n      Est. 70 hours.\n    • Brief writeups on several \"household name\" charities to give a feel\n      for why we don't recommend them.  There are ~20 total \"household name\"\n      charities but we don't have to cover them all; we estimate ~5 hours\n      each for 4 charities.\n    • Financial analysis of many charities to provide context on what's\n      \"normal\" for a charity for our metrics (metrics discussed at\n      http://www.givewell.net/node/351).  Est. 20 hours.\n\n\n\n\nNotes on time cost estimates\n\n\nAll of the above estimates are fairly conservative, some more so than\nothers.\n\n    • #1 and #4 are based on reasonable data on how long similar tasks take,\n      although much of #4 is \"optional.\"\n    • #2 could take substantially less than 40 hours.\n    • #3 is the most uncertain and conservative estimate – the figure is\n      based on our review of the Carter Center; we believe we can do other\n      charities more efficiently from here, and other promising charities\n      are likely to be substantially simpler (i.e., running fewer programs).\n\n"

This is the reason for\n      the lower-than-expected salary costs.\n    • Accounting costs are overstated due  to  year-end  estimate  of  audit\n      prep.  We initially (for  the  projection)  estimated  audit  prep  as\n      costing $1500, but estimated it at $5000  near  year-end  due  to  our\n      decision  to  outsource  bookkeeping  costs.   The  final   cost   was\n      $4,234.35, but it was counted as $5000 on the 2008  financials  (which\n      are now closed).  An offsetting entry was made in the 2009  financials\n      (see below).\n    • Funds intended for regranting have been held until this meeting, where\n      we will be voting on granting them.  The $25,000 listed was granted to\n      our DAF for administrative reasons (in order to open the account).\n\n\n                     Final expenses for 1/1/09 – 6/30/09\n\n                                    [pic]\n\nNotes:\n    • Accounting costs attributed to 2008 – the $6,500 fee and a substantial\n      portion of bookkeeping costs – were erroneously included in this\n      projected budget.  Actual 2009 bookkeeping costs were offset to\n      correct for the overestimate of costs in 2008 (see above).\n    • It appears that salaries & benefits for co-founders were\n      underestimated in the most recent projection (the projection read \"5\n      months\" when in fact it was a projection for 6 months).\n    • Payroll processing fees are currently included in \"salaries &\n      benefits\" rather than in \"Accounting.\"\n\n                                Future budget\nCash reserves\n\n                                    [pic]\n\nProjected expenses\n[pic]\n\n\nHow long we could operate with no further revenue\n\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n\n\nExcess reserves\n\n\nWe wish to be  an  organization  that  (a)  continually  has  to  \"earn  our\nexistence\" (b) does not excessively hold reserves that could  reasonably  be\ngiven out to accomplish concrete good.\n\nConsistent with this principle, we  intend  to  create  an  \"Reserve  Assets\npolicy\" that formally defines \"excess reserves\" – i.e.,  reserves  over  and\nabove what we feel  is  reasonable  to  hold  in  our  own  accounts,  which\ntherefore can and should be granted to outstanding charities.\n\nWe have  not  yet  settled  on  a  formal  policy  for  determining  \"excess\nreserves.\"  For this meeting, we take a  fairly  conservative  approach:  we\ndefine \"excess reserves\" as unrestricted reserves over  and  above  what  we\nwould need to operate through 6/30/2010, according to the most  conservative\nprojection above.\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n"

Major priorities for the remainder of the year are:\n\n    • Improving and \"reality checking\" the content of our 2008-2009 report\n         o Getting and responding to feedback on the report\n         o Researching and awarding a $250,000 grant for economic\n           empowerment in sub-Saharan Africa\n         o Adding optional but valuable content to our existing report,\n           largely by managing new hires\n         o Visiting the field operations of our top charities\n    • Pursuing new sources of funding for operating expenses (foundations\n      and fellowships)\n    • Annual self-evaluation and formal plan for our next year\n    • Improving the packaging and presentation of our research\n\n\n\n\n                       Progress since 3/31/09 meeting\n\n\nBetween 3/31/09-7/1/09, our focus was on publishing our 2008-2009\ninternational aid recommendations and reasoning.\n\nWe published this report on 7/1 – see http://www.givewell.net/node/435\n\nThe report includes\n    • Reviews of two \"top-rated charities\" that we have significantly more\n      confidence in than any other charity we have evaluated to date,\n      including the recommended charities from our 2007-2008 research on\n      international aid.\n    • Reviews of four \"recommended charities\" that we believe are\n      substantially stronger than other charities we've evaluated, though\n      not as strong as our \"top-rated\" charities.  The six \"recommended\" or\n      \"top-rated\" charities are all options for people who have made\n      GiveWell Pledges or GiveWell Advance Donations.\n    • Substantial detail on other charities we examined and why we highlight\n      the charities we do.\n\nSince 7/1/09, we have focused on\n\n    • Getting and incorporating feedback on our 2008-2009 recommendations\n      (primarily from charities and supporters at this point).\n    • Managing and evaluating two new hires – Melissa Krauss and Natalie\n      Stone – who have primarily worked on adding what we consider \"optional\n      but valuable\" content to the 2008-2009 report (including proofreading,\n      financial analysis of recommended charities, and background on non-\n      recommended interventions).\n    • Beginning work on giving out a grant in economic empowerment (more\n      below)\n    • Preparing new policies and other materials for this Board meeting.\n\n\n                   Priorities for 7/27/09 through 12/31/09\n\n\n\nOne of our priorities is to complete a thorough self-review and detailed\nplan.  We have not yet completed this, and here we give only a rough\noverview of important goals and our planned time allocation.\n\n\nNote that \"time costs\" refer only to Holden Karnofsky/Elie Hassenfeld time.\n We do not include here, but will need to continue spending time on,\nmiscellaneous tasks such as completing our financial audit, responding to\nemails and networking opportunities, etc.\n\n\n\n\nResearch: Feedback\n\nTime cost: intermittent; 2-3 hours total (including setting up calls,\ntalking, and cleaning up notes) per person consulted\n\nWe plan on actively pursuing feedback on our report from people with\nrelevant experience and expertise, particularly the people we have already\nspoken with about our report in progress (see\nhttp://www.givewell.net/node/383).  We will record and publicly post as\nmuch as we can from these conversations.\n\n\nResearch: Economic Empowerment Grant\n\n\nTime cost: significant\n\n\nWe have $250,000 that is earmarked to be regranted by 12/31/2009 to a\ncharity focusing on economic empowerment in sub-Saharan Africa.  To date we\nhave located no outstanding economic empowerment charities (see\nhttp://givewell.net/node/413).\n\nWe are currently compiling a list of potentially eligible charities.  We\nplan on inviting eligible charities to apply for grants, using a process\nsimilar to the research process from our first year (although we will be\naiming to make simpler, more specific requests – based on our independent\nresearch – in our \"field narrowing\" round 1).\n\nIf we are unable to identify an outstanding charity, we will use the\n$250,000 to fund further research and/or evaluation in this area.  The\ndonor who provided the $250,000 has signed off on this plan.\n\n\nResearch: Optional but Valuable Content\n\nTime cost: ~60 hours of our time; much of the work to be done by new hires\n\nWe intend to add content to our existing report including:\n    • Paraphrased transcripts of conversations we've had with international\n      aid experts and charity representatives.  We already have these\n      transcripts in rough form; they will need to be cleaned up and\n      approved by the people we spoke with.\n    • More examined charities (i.e., keeping up with new submissions through\n      our \"charity submission form\" as well as scanning a few more sources\n      of eligible charities)\n    • Writeups on programs commonly run by charities, discussing the\n      available information and major concerns about such programs.  (Note\n      that we already have many such writeups, particularly for the programs\n      we find most promising and for those that are most prominent.)\n    • Integration of new materials from current recommended charities, and\n      updates on \"pending\" charities\n\n\nResearch: Visit(s) to the Developing World\n\n\nTime cost: 1-2 weeks (40-80 working hours lost) per trip; 1-2 trips total\n\n\nWe would like to observe and report on the operations of our top-rated\ncharities in the field, in person (and to look at some other representative\ncharities if we can).\n\n\nFundraising\n\nTime cost: intermittent/hard to estimate at this point.  5-10 hours per\ndonor that we engage with seriously.\n\nWe intend to explore foundations and fellowships as sources of stable\noperating funding.  We have a preliminary list of target foundations and\nfellowships, and intend to get in touch with them and apply to the most\npromising ones.\n\n\nAnnual self-evaluation and plan\n\n\nTime cost: 40-80 hours\n\n\nWe intend to complete a thorough evaluation of our second year, and plan\nfor our third year, along the lines of the report we completed for our\nfirst year (available at http://givewell.net/business-plan-\nhistory#Firstyearreviewpublished6192008).\n\n\nPackaging/presentation of research\n\nTime cost: unknown; likely significant\n\nWe aim to dramatically improve the packaging and presentation of our\nresearch, both by completing a print presentation and by improving our\nwebsite (likely involving a professional website consultant).\n"

          "text": "\n                     Report on professional development\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nAt our 11/10/2008 meeting, we agreed that:\n\n    • The co-Founders and senior staff of GiveWell – and in particular\n      Holden Karnofsky, the hopeful Executive Director – lack life and\n      business experience, and would benefit from a professional development\n      effort: a concerted effort to learn from those who have such\n      experience.\n    • The most promising approach to professional development is through\n      mentor relationships with GiveWell supporters.\n    • Formal programs appear to hold little promise, although highly\n      competitive programs (specifically Ashoka, Draper Richards and Echoing\n      Green) may be worth applying to.\n\nSince then, we have developed a set of mentor relationships, as well as\nlooking into (but ultimately, to this point, not pursuing) other options.\nWe now feel that:\n\n    • We have complied with the Board's decision and have substantially\n      improved our ability (and tendency) to get feedback from more\n      experienced people.\n    • Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld should be named co-Executive\n      Directors, primarily for reasons of transparency (they have been\n      filling these roles \"de facto\" throughout GiveWell's existence).\n      Certain forms, particularly grant applications, request the name of\n      the Executive Director, and we have had to respond that we have none.\n\nDetails on our professional development efforts follow.\n\n\nProfessional development through mentor relationships\n\n\nLindy Miller: We have had phone updates with Board member Lindy Miller,\ngenerally with both Holden and Elie on the line, approximately once per\nweek.  We have updated her on our progress and priorities and asked\nquestions about a variety of issues, particularly relating to\nrecruiting/hiring/managing new employees.\n\nRob Shavell: We have had periodic in-person and phone updates with Rob\nShavell, a supporter with Silicon Valley startup experience.  Earlier in\nthe year, we were speaking with him once every 1-2 weeks about time\nmanagement, prioritization, and recruiting/hiring.  Updates were less\nfrequent during May and June as we focused on completing our research\nreport, but we are expecting more frequent contact again as we put more\neffort into improving our website and \"packaging\" of our research.\n\nRob has also been included on biweekly updates and in discussions of our\nname/domain.\n\nPhil Steinmeyer: We have periodic phone and email conversations with Phil\nSteinmeyer, who has been following our project closely and has an\nentrepreneurial background.  He has given big-picture feedback on the major\nchallenges and priorities of GiveWell as a whole, as well as feedback on\nthe progress of our research (over the research-feedback email list).\n\nPhil has also been included on biweekly updates and certain other specific\ndiscussions.\n\nAdam Goozh: Adam emailed the Harvard-Startups email list I subscribe to\noffering to share his experience from successfully starting a company.  I\ncontacted him and we had a couple general conversations about GiveWell, its\nmission, and its priorities; we have also included him in discussions about\nour name/domain and gotten a referral from him for a website consultant.\nWe have not included him in biweekly updates.\n\n\nOther professional development options\n\n\nWe have not put much effort into pursuing formal entrepreneurship groups\nsince the 11/10/08 meeting, at which we agreed that such options hold\nlittle promise.  We have continued to monitor the Entrepreneurs'\nOrganization, for which we are ineligible because we are a nonprofit, and\nHolden attended the first meeting of the \"Social Entrepreneurship / Non-\nProfit Career Group\" at the Harvard Club of New York (as we said he would\nat the 11/10/2008 meeting) but found it to be a poor fit (it was targeted\nat people currently employed in for-profit jobs who were considering\nhelping nonprofits on the side).\n\nWe have done some inquiry into the three competitive programs mentioned at\nthe 11/10/08 meeting.  We are ineligible (too large) for the Echoing Green\nprogram; we are eligible for the Ashoka and Draper Richards programs.  Both\nAshoka and Draper Richards accept applications on a rolling basis but have\nlong (several months) processes for deciding; we have not yet applied to\neither.\n\n"

Fiscal Policies and Procedures - Introduction\n\n\n\nThe Clear Fund is committed to developing and maintaining fiscal policies\nand procedures that ensure sound internal controls, fiscal responsibility\nand accountability in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (GAAP), and adherence to the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (FASB) rules and regulations.  As a not-for-profit organization, The\nClear Fund is entrusted with funds granted by government, private\nfoundations, and/or individual contributors and must adhere to high of\nstandards of accounting.\n\nThe internal control structure consists of policies and procedures that\nhave been established to achieve The Clear Fund’s objectives. More\nspecifically, the control structure represents those policies and\nprocedures that affect the organization’s ability to process, record,\nsummarize, and report financial information.  This structure is established\nand maintained to reduce the potential unauthorized use of The Clear Fund’s\nassets or misstatement of account balances.\n\nThe internal control structure is composed of the following basic elements:\n(1) the control environment; (2) the accounting system; (3) control\nprocedures; and (4) the accounting cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Control Environment\n\nThe control environment reflects the importance The Clear Fund places on\ninternal controls as part of its day-to-day activities.  Factors that\ninfluence the control environment can include management and Board\nphilosophy, organizational structure, ways of assigning authority and\nresponsibility, methods of management and control, personnel policies and\npractices, protection of informants of improper activities, and external\ninfluences such as significant funder expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Accounting System\n\nThe accounting system comprises the methods, accounting software, and\nrecords used to identify, assemble, classify, record, and report accounting\ntransactions.  At a minimum, it is set up to:\n\n      • Identify and record all of The Clear Fund’s transactions.\n\n      • Describe the transactions in enough detail to allow classification\n        for financial reporting.\n\n      • Indicate the time period in which transactions occurred in order to\n        record them in the proper accounting period.\n\n\n\n\n\nControl Procedures\n\nControl procedures are the procedures set up to strengthen The Clear Fund’s\ninternal control structure and thus safeguard the agency assets.  They are\ndivided into the following:\n\n      • Segregation of Duties: Allocation of tasks are needed so that one\n        individual does not have the ability to both make an accounting\n        error (either intentionally or unintentionally) and also cover it\n        up.\n\n      • Restricted Access: Physical access to valuable and movable assets\n        is restricted to authorized personnel.  Systems access to make\n        changes in accounting records is restricted to authorized\n        personnel.\n\n      • Document Control:  To ensure that all documents are captured by the\n        accounting system, all documents must be pre-numbered and the\n        sequence for documents must be accounted for.  To ensure compliance\n        with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s provision to prevent destruction of\n        litigation-related documents, The Clear Fund has adopted policies\n        and procedures for document retention.\n\n      • Processing Control:  This is designed to catch errors before they\n        are posted to the general ledger.  Common processing controls are\n        the following:  batch controls; source document matching; clerical\n        accuracy of documents; and general ledger account code checking.\n\n      • Reconciliation Controls:  These are designed to catch errors after\n        transactions have been posted to the general ledger, including\n        reconciling selected general ledger control accounts to subsidiary\n        ledgers.\n\n\n\n\nThe Accounting Cycle\n\nThe overall purpose of an accounting system is to accurately process,\nrecord, summarize, and report transactions of The Clear Fund.\n\nThe component bookkeeping cycles fall into one of four primary functions:\n\n   1. Revenue, accounts receivable, and cash receipts\n\n      Key steps in this area are:\n\n      • Processing cash receipts\n\n      • Making deposits\n\n      • Recording cash receipts in the general ledger and subsidiary\n        records\n\n      • Performing month-end reconciliation procedures\n\n   2. Purchases, accounts payable, and cash disbursements\n\n      Key steps in this area are:\n\n      • Authorizing the procurement of goods and/or services\n\n      • Processing purchase transactions\n\n      • Processing invoices\n\n      • Issuing checks\n\n      • Recording checks in the general ledger and in cash disbursements\n        journals\n\n      • Performing month-end reconciliation procedures\n\n      • Year-end reporting-1099 forms\n\n\n   3. Payroll\n\n      The payroll process consists of processing payroll and remitting\n      amounts due to employees, the government, and other agencies such as\n      health insurers, retirement plan trustees, etc.\n\n      Key steps in this area are:\n\n      • Obtaining and gathering information for processing\n\n      • Preparing payroll checks and depositing payroll taxes\n\n      • Performing month-end reconciliation procedures\n\n      • Preparing quarterly payroll tax returns\n\n      • Preparing W-2s, the W-3, and other annual payroll tax returns\n\n   4. General Ledger and Financial Statements\n\n      The general ledger process consists of posting the period’s\n      transactions to the general ledger and preparing the financial\n      statements.\n\n      Key steps in this area are:\n\n      •     Preparing monthly, quarterly, and annual journal entries\n\n      •     Reconciling bank accounts and other general ledger accounts\n\n      •     Reviewing general ledger activity and posting adjusting journal\n        entries\n\n      •     Producing the general ledger and financial statements\n\n\n\n\nSarbanes-Oxley Act\n\nThe American Competitiveness and Corporate Accountability Act of 2002, also\nknown as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, was passed in response to the corporate\naccounting scandals that took place in 2001 and 2002.  According to the\nlaw, publicly traded companies must now adhere to new governance standards\nthat give board members a greater oversight role regarding financial\ntransactions and auditing procedures.  Although most of the provisions of\nthe act apply only to publicly traded corporations, two provisions of the\nlaw apply to not-for-profit organizations including provisions for\nwhistleblowers and document retention.\n\nWhistleblower:  Section 1107 of the act, Retaliation Against Informants,\napplies to all entities, public or private.  It states that it is illegal\nto retaliate against a “whistleblower.”  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act does not\nrequire organizations to have a whistleblower policy; however, it is in an\norganization’s best interest to do so.  The Clear Fund has adopted a\nwhistleblower policy that provides clear procedures for handling\nwhistleblower complaints.  It can be found in Chapter 7.\n\nDocument Retention:  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also addresses the destruction\nof litigation-related documents.  The law makes it a crime to alter, cover\nup, falsify, or destroy any document (or persuade someone else to do so) to\nprevent its use in an official proceeding.  Like their for-profit\ncounterparts, not-for-profits need to maintain appropriate records about\ntheir operations.  The Clear Fund has adopted a written, mandatory document\nretention policy.  The policy can be found in Chapter 5 of this manual.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.  Revenue, Accounts Receivable, and Cash Receipts\n\n\n\n\n2.1  CASH RECEIPTS AND BANK DEPOSITS\n\nPolicies & Controls\n\n   1. All cash receipts are received, logged, and appropriately endorsed on\n      a timely basis.\n\n   2. Cash receipts are accurately processed and recorded on the accrual\n      basis of accounting.\n\n\n\nAgency Procedures to Implement These Policies\n\n   1. All cash receipts are received, logged, and appropriately endorsed on\n      a timely basis.\n\n           Opening the mail\n\nAll mail is directed to the Manager of Finance and Administration (Manager\nof Finance). The Manager of Finance segregates checks, logs them in on a\ndaily basis on the Daily Check Log, and restrictively endorses all checks\n“for deposit only” payable to The Clear Fund.\n\nThe Manager of Finance and Administration (Manager of Finance) makes a copy\nof all checks and provides the copies with the Daily Check Log to the co-\nExecutive Director who is not the Manager of Finance (Independent\nExecutive). The Independent Executive codes the check copy with the\nappropriate revenue code and places it in the “Checks Received” folder for\nrecording into the accounting system by the Manager of Finance.\n\n           Preparing the bank deposit\n\nThe Manager of Finance prepares the checks with the general bank account\nnumber and prepares a deposit ticket for each account for which checks are\nreceived. Deposits are consecutively numbered for each account.\n\n            Making the deposit\n\nChecks are deposited as soon as possible by the Manager of Finance.  Checks\nthat are not deposited on the day of receipt are kept in a secure location,\naccess to which is limited to the Independent Executive and Manager of\nFinance.\n\n\n\n   2. Cash receipts are accurately processed and recorded on the accrual\n      basis of accounting.\n\n           Verifying the deposit\n\nDeposits are verified against authenticated deposit tickets on a periodic\nbasis.  Upon receipt, the validated deposit ticket is matched against\npending deposits in the “Checks Received” folder by the Independent\nExecutive. The deposit ticket is stapled to the check copy and filed by the\nManager of Finance. Any discrepancy is resolved jointly by the Manager of\nFinance and the Independent Executive.\n\n           Recording receipts\n\nThe Manager of Finance records the deposit in the fundraising module and\nmarks the deposit package “posted” upon completion of data entry.\n\n           Processing and recording electronic funds transfers\n\nFor receipts other than cash or checks (for example, electronic funds\ntransfers including contract or grant payments), the Independent Executive\ncodes the relevant advice document with the appropriate revenue code, and\nforwards it to the Manager of Finance.\n\nNotices/advices received in the mail are coded by the Executive Director.\n\nThe Manager of Finance reconciles the deposit with the receivable and\nrecords it to the fundraising module.\n\nProcessing and recording stock donations\n\nWhen The Clear Fund is contacted by a donor who wishes to make a stock\ndonation, the Executive Director directs the donor to The Clear Fund’s\nbroker for immediate transfer of stock. Stock donations are liquidated\nimmediately upon receipt unless donor stipulates otherwise. Stock donations\nare recorded at their fair market value at the time of receipt.  All stock\ndonations are reviewed and approved by the Independent Executive who then\nforwards them to the Manager of Finance to record in the general ledger.\nCopies of documentation reflecting the fair market value of the donated\nstock are also forwarded to the Board Treasurer at the end of the quarter.\n\n\n\n\n2.2  REVENUE RECOGNITION AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\n\nPolicies & Controls\n\n   1. Revenue is recognized when earned and when contributions are received\n      or awarded.\n\n\n\nAgency Procedures to Implement These Policies\n\n   1. Revenue is recognized when earned and when contributions are received\n      or awarded.\n\n           Pledges/grants receivable\n\nIn compliance with accounting principles, revenue is recognized when earned\nand when contributions are received or awarded on the accrual basis of\naccounting.\n\nAll grant letters, pledges and promises to give are forwarded to the\nManager of Finance upon receipt.  The Manager of Finance reviews the\ndocumentation and records promises to give as receivable depending on the\nprobability of receipt.\n\nThe Manager of Finance offsets receivable accounts with payments received.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Manager of Finance forwards the accounts\nreceivable aging report to the Independent Executive to determine what, if\nany, steps are needed to collect or adjust the remaining receivables.\n\nThe Manager of Finance reconciles donations received to the fundraising\nmodule on a monthly basis during the bank reconciliation.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3  CONTRIBUTIONS: ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISCLOSURE\n\nPolicies & Controls\n\n   1. Acknowledgment letters with appropriate disclosures are sent to donors\n      to substantiate donations.\n\n\n\nAgency Procedures to Implement These Policies\n\n   1. Acknowledgment letters with appropriate disclosures are sent to donors\n      to substantiate donations.\n\n           Acknowledgment letters\n\nFor each contribution received, regardless of amount, the Executive\nDirector issues an acknowledgment of receipt of the contribution to the\ndonor.  The acknowledgment includes:\n\n      • The amount of cash and a description of any other property\n        contributed\n\n      • A statement about whether The Clear Fund provided any goods or\n        services in return for the contribution\n\n      • A description and an estimated value of the item provided if The\n        Clear Fund provided something in return for the contribution\n\nAdditional guidance in the form of examples and suggested language for\nacknowledgements can be found at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1771.pdf.\n\n           Written Disclosure\n\nSince a donor may only take a contribution deduction to the extent that\nhis/her contribution exceeds the fair market value of the goods or services\nthe donor receives in return for the contribution, donors need to know the\nvalue of the goods or services provided by The Clear Fund.  A written\ndisclosure of the quid pro quo amount, or value of goods and services\nreceived by the donor in exchange for the contribution, is required by The\nClear Fund if the donor makes any payment in excess of $75.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3.  Purchasing, Accounts Payable, and Cash Disbursements\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1 PURCHASING\n\nPolicies and Controls\n\n3.1.1 Goods and services are purchased using the best combination of\n      quality, service, and price.\n\n3.1.2 Only authorized purchase commitments are made and received.\n\n\n\nAgency Procedures to Implement These Policies\n\n3.3.1 Goods and services are purchased using the best combination of\n      quality, service, and price.\n\n           Purchase requests\n\nAll purchases and expenditures are reviewed and approved by the Executive\nDirector prior to purchase commitment.\n\n           Competitive bidding\n\nTwo written or verbal bids are required for the purchase of furnishings,\nequipment, and technology items costing $5,000 or more. Written\nadvertisements (including copies of web-based prices) of available products\nwill be deemed acceptable evidence of bid price. Original bid documentation\nsupporting the vendor selection and vendor invoice is reviewed by the\nExecutive Director.\n\nWhenever the vendor selected is not the lowest bidder, the reasons for the\nselection (e.g., service, timeliness, special features) are documented and\nmaintained with the disbursement documentation in the files.\n\nCertain professional services, due to their nature, are not subject to the\nbidding process. However, any purchase or contract that costs $25,000 or\nmore must be approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nBoard members and employees sign written conflict-of-interest statements\n(see the Clear Fund Bylaws) to maintain a high level of integrity from self-\ndealing issues.\n\n           Sole Sourced Vendors\n\nIn the rare exception where only one vendor is available for a product or\nservice, the vendor is considered a sole sourced vendor.  In the case of\nsole sourced vendors, no competitive bidding is required.  Any sole sourced\nvendor purchases should be documented and approved by the appropriate level\nof management.\n\n            Preferred Vendor Listing\n\nNegotiations with preferred vendors are highly recommended for areas like\noffice supplies and food, where bulk or wholesale rates may apply.  The\npreferred vendor listing is maintained and updated by the Manager of\nFinance.  Competitive bidding does not need to be performed for purchases\nmade from vendors on this listing.\n\n\n      Exemption from sales tax\n\nThe Clear Fund is recognized as a tax-exempt organization under Federal, NY\nState, and local laws. As such, The Clear Fund is exempt from sales taxes\non goods purchased for its own use. All purchasers are expected to use the\nsales tax exemption form for all purchases. Sales tax will not be\nreimbursed to employees for purchases in amounts greater than $10.00.\n\nThe Clear Fund staff may use the sales tax exemption form only when\npurchasing goods and services on behalf of The Clear Fund.  Tax exemption\ndoes not apply to hotel, airfare, or communication-related taxes such as\nthose on telephone bills.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Only authorized purchase commitments are made and received.\n\n           Receipt of goods and merchandise\n\nThe Manager of Finance signs for and receives goods and merchandise and\nperforms the following:\n\n      • Verifies that each item on the packing slip has been received.\n\n      • Notes any back orders or discrepancies as to quantity or price.\n\n      • Retains original documents with noted discrepancies (if any).\n\n\n\n3.2  PROCESSING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE\n\nPolicies and Controls\n\n3.2.1 Only authorized and accurate expenditures are made and recorded.\n\n3.2.2 Only authorized and accurate check disbursements are made.\n\n\n\nAgency Procedures to Implement These Policies\n\n3.2.1 Only authorized and accurate expenditures are made and recorded.\n\n           Receipt of invoice\n\nAll mail is directed to the Manager of Finance, who marks invoices with a\n“received date” upon receipt. Invoices are given to the Independent\nExecutive, who codes the invoice with the appropriate expense code and\napproves it for payment. The invoice is placed in a folder for the Manager\nof Finance. The Manager of Finance is responsible for the following:\n\n      • Verifying that proper accounting codes are assigned per the chart\n        of accounts\n\n      • Accruing the expense to the appropriate expense category and\n        fund/cost center if applicable for major expenses\n\n      • Investigating and resolving any outstanding back order issues with\n        the individual responsible for the purchase\n\nThe Manager of Finance or outsourced fiscal consultant enters in the\ninvoice into the accounting system.\n\n           Other payment requests\n\nDisbursements are made based on original invoices. In the case that there\nis no invoice (for example, a travel advance) the employee requesting the\ndisbursement prepares the request in writing, and submits it to the\nExecutive Director for approval.  Once approved, this request is processed\nin the same manner as an invoice.\n\n            Cash Advances\n\nCash Advances are not issued by The Clear Fund.\n\n            Stipends\n\nStipends are not issued by The Clear Fund.\n\n\n\n\n      3.2.2 Only authorized and accurate check disbursements are made.\n\n           Paying invoices\n\nApproval is needed for any payment issued by The Clear Fund, according to\nthe guidelines set out in Section 3.5.\n\nOnce approval is secured for a particular invoice, the Manager of Finance\nmay pay the invoice using the online bill payment system of the Clear\nFund's (checking) bank account.  The Manager of Finance may alternately\nelect to pay the invoice using a manual check (which requires signatures\naccording to the guidelines set out in Section 3.5), a credit/debit card\n(subject to the guidelines in Section 3.3), or a payroll credit (in the\ncase of employee reimbursements).\n\nWhen a payment is made, the check register is updated by the Manager of\nFinance or outsourced fiscal consultant in the accounting system. This\nupdate process reduces the accounts payable balance and the cash account\nbalance to the general ledger.\n\nOutstanding payables are paid when due.\n\n           Check writing security\n\nAll check stock is kept in a locked drawer, access to which is limited to\nthe Manager of Finance.  All checks taken are logged to ensure that a\nreconciliation of checks taken and processed can be performed.\n\nCredit card payments and employee reimbursements may not be made via manual\ncheck.\n\n           Authorized signatures\n\nAuthorized check signers are laid out in Section 3.5. Authorized signers\nreview the contracts, invoices, coding, and other supporting documentation\nprior to signature.\n\nNo employee may sign a check payable to himself/herself. On an annual\nbasis, the Independent Executive submits a list of all bank accounts and\nauthorized signers to the Board of Directors for approval.\n\n           Mailing checks\n\nFollowing payment, a vendor invoice is filed in the paid bills files by\nvendor. The Manager of Finance marks the invoice \"PAID\" with the date,\ncheck number and amount paid.\n\n\n\n3.3 CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS\n\nPolicies and Controls\n\n\n3.3.1 Only authorized personnel are issued credit cards and must agree to\n      adhere to The Clear Fund’s credit card policies.\n\n3.3.2 Policies ensure that only appropriate expenses are reimbursed.\n\n3.3.3 All supporting documentation is received prior to payment.\n\n3.3.4 Employees will reimburse The Clear Fund for non-reimbursable\n      expenses.\n\n\n\nAgency Procedures to Implement These Policies\n\n3.3.1 Only authorized personnel are issued credit cards and must agree to\n      adhere to The Clear Fund’s credit card policies.\n\n           Issuing credit cards\n\nThe Manager of Finance holds a debit card to be used for business purposes\nonly. Staff can be issued a card with approval from the Executive Director.\n Employees who receive a credit or debit card are required to sign the The\nClear Fund Credit/Debit Card Agreement stating policies and procedures to\nbe followed for the use of the card.\n\nIndividuals who do not adhere to these policies and procedures risk\nrevocation of their credit/debit card privileges and/or disciplinary\naction, up to and including termination.\n\nAgency credit/debit cards are issued in the name of the employee and the\nemployee is responsible for:\n\n      • Ensuring security of the credit/debit card\n\n      • Restricting use to business purposes\n\n      • All balances on the account\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Policies ensure that only appropriate expenses are reimbursed.\n\n           Proper and improper use of cards\n\nCredit/debit cards may be used for authorized travel, administrative, and\nprogram-related expenses incurred during the course of conducting business.\nCredit/debit cards are never to be used for personal expenses. Cash\nadvances on credit/debit cards are prohibited.\n\nProcedures regarding pre-approvals for purchases and competitive bidding\napply to credit/debit card purchases.   Additionally, cardholders should\nmake every effort to ensure that purchases do not include sales tax.\n\n           Transaction limits\n\nThe spending limit for each credit/debit card issued must be adhered to,\nand cardholders must monitor their usage to ensure that spending does not\nexceed the limit.\n\n\n\n3.3.3 All supporting documentation is received prior to payment.\n\n           Documentation and recordkeeping requirements\n\nAn employee may request use of a credit card and must obtain pre-approval\nfrom the Executive Director. After making the purchase, the employee\nsubmits original receipts to the Independent Executive who codes expenses\nto the appropriate projects and forwards original receipts to the Manager\nof Finance for reconciliation to the monthly credit card statement (or bank\nstatement in the case of a debit card).\n\nThe Manager of Finance reconciles the monthly statement and ensures that\nall expenses are supported with receipts.

When there is a conflict between federal, state\nand local record retention requirements, the longer retention period\nprevails. Certain important records, as determined by the Board, will be\nretained permanently, even if their retention is not required by law.\n\n            E-mail retention\n\nThe retention requirement for e-mail messages is determined by its content.\nIt is the user’s responsibility to appropriately classify an e-mail message\naccording to categories listed in the record retention schedules below and\nset up parameters for archiving their e-mail messages.  Whether in\nelectronic format or paper copy, e-mail correspondence is retained based on\nthe record retention schedule.\n\n            Record destruction\n\nOnce the retention period has expired, The Clear Fund may destroy the\nrecords in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of its contents. The\nBoard of Directors approves all destruction of records prior to\ncommencement.  Record destruction is performed under the direction of the\nIndependent Executive and the Manager of Finance, who is responsible for\nmaintaining the record disposal log, which lists all records that were\ndestroyed.\n\nUpon receipt of any legal notice, all record destruction will cease until\nthe end of the investigation.\n\n5.3.2 Record retention requirements are reviewed annually with the

Assets and Liabilities\n\n\n\n\n6.1  CAPITAL ASSETS\n\n\nPolicies & Controls\n\n\n6.1.1 Written requests for the purchase of capital assets are supported by\n      sufficient operational and financial justification and are\n      appropriately approved.\n\n6.1.2 All fixed assets are properly identified, tagged, tracked, and\n      inventoried on an annual basis.\n\n6.1.3.      Only leases and purchases that materially add to the value of\n      the property and prolong the useful life are deemed to be capital\n      assets.\n\n6.1.4 Depreciable and non-depreciable fixed assets are appropriately\n      recorded and depreciated.\n\n6.1.5 Disposals of capital assets are properly authorized and recorded.\n\n\n\nAgency Procedures to Implement These Policies\n\n\n\n6.1.1 Written requests for the purchase of capital assets are supported by\n      sufficient operational and financial justification and are\n      appropriately approved.\n\n           Capital budget\n\nWhen applicable, The Clear Fund prepares a capital budget as part of the\nannual budget process, which represents a long-term capital requirements\nanalysis.  The Board approves the capital budget.\n\n           Asset purchase\n\nCapital assets are purchased in accordance with The Clear Fund's purchasing\npolicies as outlined in Chapter 3.\n\n\n\n6.1.2 All fixed assets are properly identified, tagged, tracked, and\n      inventoried on an annual basis.\n\n           Identification of capital assets\n\nAcquisitions which add to the value of the property and prolong the useful\nlife are deemed to be capital assets.  The Clear Fund considers fixed\nassets costing $1,000 or more to be capital assets.  Capital assets are\ncategorized into one of the following categories:\n\n      • Land\n\n      • Buildings and building improvements\n\n      • Furniture, fixtures, and office equipment (includes desks, chairs,\n        file cabinets and copiers, telephone, etc.)\n\n      • Leasehold improvements (includes replacing floors, roofing, etc in\n        a leased building)\n\n      • Computer equipment (includes computers, printers, etc.)\n\n      • Construction in progress (includes work on a building that is not\n        complete)\n\n      • Automobiles and transportation equipment\n\n      • Equipment leased under terms that meet criteria for capital leases\n\n           Tagging and tracking of capital assets\n\nDetailed fixed asset subledgers are maintained for each of the capital\nasset categories.  At the time of acquisition, all capital assets are\ntagged with unique identifying numbers and entered into the fixed asset\nledger.  The tags are numerically sequenced and placed on a visible area of\nthe asset in order to provide a clear method of tracing the asset to the\nfixed asset ledger.  The following information is tracked:\n\n      • Name and description\n\n      • Serial number, model number, or other identification\n\n      • Vendor name, acquisition date and cost\n\n      • Location and condition of equipment\n\n      • Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal\n\nIf possible, persons other than those who maintain subsidiary records for\nindividual assets are responsible for the custody of the assets.\n\n           Inventory process\n\nOn an annual basis, The Clear Fund takes a physical inventory of all assets\nto ensure the completeness and accuracy of the agency’s records.  All\nassets are examined to determine that they are currently in use.\n\nThe inventory of the assets on hand is compared to the fixed asset ledger.\nAll differences are analyzed and resolved by the Manager of Finance and\nreviewed by the Independent Executive.  Adjustments to the agency’s records\ncan be made only after appropriate approval has been received.\n\n\n\n6.1.3.      Only leases and purchases that materially add to the value of\n      the property and prolong the useful life are deemed to be capital\n      assets.\n\n           Lease-versus-purchase decision\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment may be obtained through long-term leases as\nan alternative to outright purchase.  The purchase-versus-lease decision is\nincorporated into the annual capital budget.  Decisions are made based on\nthe net cost of the asset, taking into consideration cash flow as well as\ntype of asset being acquired.\n\n           Requirements for capitalization\n\nIf a lease meets certain requirements, it is capitalized, with an\noffsetting capital lease obligation.  A lease meets the requirements of a\ncapital lease if it is non-cancelable and has at least one of the following\ncharacteristics:\n\n      • It passes title to the lessee (The Clear Fund).\n\n      • It contains a bargain purchase option.\n\n      • The lease term is at least 75% of the asset’s estimated life.\n\n      • The present value of the minimum lease payments equals 90% of the\n        asset’s fair value.\n\nOperating lease payments are deemed to be equipment rental expense.  A\ndetermination that the lease is classified as a capital lease should be\nmade prior to the beginning of the lease term.  The capital lease is\nrecorded as an asset and a liability for an amount equal to the total\nminimum lease payments, and should be amortized over either the estimated\nuseful life or the lease term depending on details of the lease\ntransaction.\n\n           Expense versus capitalization of expenditures\n\nRepair and maintenance expenditures are distinguished from expenditures for\nimprovements, additions, renovations, alterations, and replacements. The\nClear Fund follows the following guidelines in classifying these\nexpenditures:\n\nRepair and maintenance expenditures do not materially add to the value or\nextend the useful life of the property. Examples of repair expenses:\n\n      • Replacing loose or damaged shingles\n\n      • Replacing broken glass\n\n      • Painting and decorating the facility\n\n      • Resurfacing a parking lot\n\n      • Making temporary repairs to last less than one year\n\n      • Making minor repairs to fully depreciated assets\n\nExpenditures that increase the value of property, extend its life, or adapt\nit to a new or different use are capital expenditures.  Significant\nimprovements to property leased by the agency, including improvements that\nadd value to the leasehold, are also capitalized.\n\nIf the useful life of the asset has been significantly extended, the\nremaining book value (original cost less depreciation) and the improvement\ncosts are depreciated over the new life.  Examples of repair expenditures\nthat are capital expenditures:\n\n      • Replacing a roof, thereby substantially prolonging its life\n\n      • Reconditioning equipment or machinery, thereby extending its life\n\n      • Installing a new boiler system\n\n      • Structural changes or alterations to organization-owned buildings,\n        which become a part of the building and increase its life or value\n\n      • Significant improvements to property leased by the organization,\n        improvements that add value to the leasehold (e.g., permanent\n        office partitions)\n\n           Assets purchased with government funds\n\nAssets purchased with government funds are tracked and monitored in the\nmanner outlined above.  However, on an interim basis, these acquisitions\nare expensed as part of the program costs reportable under the grant.  At\nthe end of the year, the full cost is capitalized and depreciated over the\nassigned asset life, in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Depreciable and non-depreciable fixed assets are appropriately\n      recorded and depreciated.\n\n           Basis for cost\n\nDepreciable assets are carried in the accounting records at the original\nnet acquisition cost.  Acquisition costs include the invoice price plus all\nexpenses incurred to prepare the asset for operations, including such costs\nas preliminary engineering studies and surveys, legal fees to establish\ntitle, installation costs, freight, and labor and material used in\nconstruction or installation.\n\nNon-depreciable capital assets (e.g., land) are carried in the records at\nthe original net cost.\n\n           Capitalization of a construction project\n\nExpenditures such as those for materials, labor, engineering, supervision,\nsalaries and expenses, legal expenses, insurance, overhead, and interest\nare capitalized as “construction-in-progress” until the project is\ncompleted and placed in service.  No depreciation is taken on construction-\nin-progress.\n\nUpon completion of construction and placement in service, the asset is\nremoved from construction-in-progress and entered into the detailed fixed\nasset ledger under the appropriate classification.  Depreciation on the\nasset begins on the date the asset is placed in service.\n\n           Determination of useful life\n\nThe useful life is estimated when a capital asset is acquired.  The useful\nlife may be expressed in terms of time, units of production, or hours of\nservice.  The cost of an asset is allocated over the useful life via\ndepreciation or depletion.  When there is an indefinite useful life, such\nas that for land, no depreciation is taken.\n\nIf there is a significant change in the estimate of the remaining useful\nlife after the asset is placed into service, the remaining cost to be\ndepreciated is spread over the revised remaining life.\n\nThe Executive Director assigns the estimated useful life as part of the\noverall asset acquisition approval process.\n\n           Depreciation method\n\nDepreciation of property and equipment is calculated by the straight-line\nor accelerated method of the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n\nCircumstances when it may be appropriate to accelerate or decelerate\ndepreciation charges for the current and future periods include:\n\n      • A significant change in the estimated useful life\n\n      • A change in the estimated salvage value\n\nThe estimated useful lives of the various asset categories at The Clear\nFund are as follows:\n\n|Description              |Years              |Method           |\n|Property and Plant       |39                 |Straight Line    |\n|Furniture & Fixtures     |7 years            |Straight Line    |\n|Office Equipment         |5 years            |Straight Line    |\n|Computer Equipment       |3 years            |Straight Line    |\n|Automobile and           |5 years            |Straight Line    |\n|Transportation Equipment |                   |                 |\n|Capital Leases           |Either lease term  |                 |\n|                         |or estimated useful|                 |\n|                         |life               |                 |\n|Leasehold Improvements   |Life of lease      |Straight Line    |\n|                         |not to exceed 10   |                 |\n|                         |years              |                 |\n\n\nAs an alternative to prorating the depreciation in the year of acquisition\nor disposal, the agency takes one half year of depreciation in both the\nyears of acquisition and disposal.\n\n\n\n   5. Disposals of capital assets are properly authorized and recorded.\n\n           Authorization of disposal\n\nControl over the disposition of property is maintained not only to preserve\nthe accuracy of the records but also to ensure that assets are safeguarded,\nimproper disposal is prevented, and the best possible terms are received\nfor disposal.\n\nDisposal of capital assets occurs only after proper authorization has been\ngiven by the Executive Director and funding agency, if applicable.\n\nThe following procedures apply to the retirement and disposal of The Clear\nFund company assets:\n\n      • An asset disposal form is completed for all disposals.\n\n      • The asset disposal form is reviewed and approved by a responsible\n        employee who is knowledgeable of but not directly responsible for\n        the asset, with ultimate approval by the Executive Director.\n\n      • No item of property, plant, or equipment is removed from the\n        premises without a properly approved Asset Disposal Form.\n\n           Recording disposal\n\nOnce the retirement or sale has been properly approved and documented, the\nfollowing procedures apply to the recording of the transaction:\n\n      • The cost is removed from the appropriate asset account.\n\n      • The related accumulated depreciation, including depreciation to\n        date of disposal, is removed from the allowance for depreciation\n        account.  The profit or loss, adjusted for the cost of removal, is\n        recorded as an income (gain) or expense (loss) item.\n\n      • When the disposal is a trade-in of a similar asset, the acquired\n        asset is recorded at the book value of the trade-in asset plus any\n        additional cash paid.  In no instance should such cost exceed the\n        fair market value for the new asset.\n\nAll disposals are recorded in the fixed assets ledger on a timely basis.\n\n           Fully depreciated assets\n\nFully depreciated assets remain in the fixed asset ledger with the related\naccumulated depreciation as long as the property is still in use to ensure\naccurate tracking and safeguarding of assets.\n\n\n\n6.2  INVESTMENTS\n\nPolicies & Controls\n\n6.2.1 The purchase and sale of investments are properly approved, recorded,\n      and reported.\n\n6.2.2 Investment statements are properly reconciled to the supporting books\n      and records on a periodic basis.\n\n\n\nPolicies & Controls\n\n6.2.1 The purchase and sale of investments are properly approved, recorded,\n      and reported.\n\n           Approval of investment purchases and disposals\n\nThe investment policies are set by the Board of Directors and are carried\nout by the Executive Director.

It states that it\nis illegal to retaliate against a “whistleblower.”  It is in an\norganization’s best interest to have a policy that provides clear\nprocedures for handling whistleblower complaints.  Proper handling of such\ncomplaints will help protect organizations from being accused of\nretaliation against whistleblowers.  Such a policy, to be effective, must\nbe circulated to all employees and board members.  It is recommended the\nBoard review and adopt a Whistleblower Policy.\n\n           General\n\nThe Clear Fund’s Code of Ethics and Conduct (“Code”) requires directors,\nofficers and employees to observe high standards of business and personal\nethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. As employees\nand representatives of The Clear Fund, we must practice honesty and\nintegrity in fulfilling our responsibilities and comply with all applicable\nlaws and regulations.\n\n           Reporting Responsibility\n\nIt is the responsibility of all directors, officers and employees to comply\nwith the Code and to report violations or suspected violations in\naccordance with this Whistleblower Policy.\n\n           No Retaliation\n\nNo director, officer or employee who in good faith reports a violation of\nthe Code shall suffer harassment, retaliation or adverse employment\nconsequence. An employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a\nviolation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including\ntermination of employment. This Whistleblower Policy is intended to\nencourage and enable employees and others to raise serious concerns within\nThe Clear Fund prior to seeking resolution outside the agency.\n\n           Reporting Violations\n\nThe Code addresses The Clear Fund’s open door policy and suggests that\nemployees share their questions, concerns, suggestions or complaints with\nsomeone who can address them properly. In most cases, an employee’s\nsupervisor is in the best position to address an area of concern. However,\nif you are not comfortable speaking with your supervisor or you are not\nsatisfied with your supervisor’s response, you are encouraged to speak with\nanyone in management or on the Board of Directors whom you are comfortable\nin approaching. Supervisors and managers are required to report suspected\nviolations of the Code of Conduct to The Clear Fund’s Compliance Officer,\nwho has specific and exclusive responsibility to investigate all reported\nviolations. For suspected fraud, or when you are not satisfied or\nuncomfortable with following The Clear Fund’s open door policy, individuals\nshould contact The Clear Fund’s Compliance Officer directly.\n\n           Compliance Officer\n\nThe Clear Fund’s Compliance Officer is responsible for investigating and\nresolving all reported complaints and allegations concerning violations of\nthe Code and, at his discretion, shall advise the Executive Director and/or\nthe Executive Committee. The Compliance Officer has direct access to the\nExecutive Committee of the board of directors and is required to report to\nthe Executive Committee at least annually on compliance activity.\n\n           Accounting and Auditing Matters\n\nThe Executive Committee of the board of directors shall address all\nreported concerns or complaints regarding accounting practices, internal\ncontrols or auditing. The Compliance Officer shall immediately notify the\nExecutive Committee of any such complaint and work with the committee until\nthe matter is resolved.\n\n           Acting in Good Faith\n\nAnyone filing a complaint concerning a violation or suspected violation of\nthe Code must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds for\nbelieving the information disclosed indicates a violation of the Code. Any\nallegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been\nmade maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious\ndisciplinary offense.\n\n           Confidentiality\n\nViolations or suspected violations may be submitted on a confidential basis\nby the complainant or may be submitted anonymously. Reports of violations\nor suspected violations will be kept confidential to the extent possible,\nconsistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.\n\n           Handling of Reported Violations\n\nThe Compliance Officer will notify the sender and acknowledge receipt of\nthe reported violation or suspected violation within five business days.\nAll reports will be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective action\nwill be taken if warranted by the investigation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8.

To that end, the Board has adopted the following charters and\npolicies:\n\n      • Equal Employment Opportunity Policy\n\n      • Sexual Harassment Policy\n\n      • Policy for Resolving Discrimination and Sexual Harassment\n        Complaints\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1 Equal Employment Opportunity Policy\n\nOur company is committed to the principles of Equal Employment Opportunity\nand is committed to making employment decisions based on merit and value.\nWe are committed to complying with all Federal, State, and local laws\nproviding Equal Employment Opportunities, as well as all laws related to\nterms and conditions of employment. We desire to keep a work environment\nwhich is free of harassment or discrimination because of sex, race,\nreligion, color, national origin, sexual orientation, physical or mental\ndisability, marital status, age or any other status protected by Federal,\nState or local laws.  We value diversity and are willing to employ men and\nwomen of all ethnic and racial groups, ranging in age from the teens to the\nsixties and older, and representing a broad spectrum of religions and\nnational origins.  The company will make every reasonable effort to\naccommodate those physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified\nemployee, unless undue hardship would result for the company.\n\nJust as the company bears a responsibility towards this policy, each of us\nmust clearly communicate our disinterest in, or offense taken to, any\nperceived verbal or physical discrimination or harassment.  We are all\nresponsible for upholding this Equal Employment Opportunity policy and\ncommitment.  Equal Employment Opportunity laws afford each one of us the\nchance to succeed or fail based on individual merit.\n\n8.2 Sexual Harassment Policy\n\nThe Clear Fund prohibits sexual harassment of its employees and applicants\nfor employment by any employee, non-employee or applicant. Such conduct may\nresult in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. This policy\ncovers all employees. The Clear Fund will not tolerate, condone or allow\nsexual harassment, whether engaged in by fellow employees, supervisors,\nassociates, clients or other non-employees who conduct business with the\nClear Fund.\n\nSexual harassment is any behavior that includes unwelcome sexual advances\nand other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n\n• submission to, or rejection of, such conduct is used as the basis for\npromotions or other employment decisions;\n\n• the conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's job performance\nor creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.\n\nClear Fund employees are entitled to work in an environment free from\nsexual harassment and a hostile or offensive working environment. We\nrecognize sexual harassment as unlawful discrimination, just as conduct\nthat belittles or demeans any individual on the basis of race, religion,\nnational origin, sexual preference, age, disability, or other similar\ncharacteristics or circumstances.\n\nNo manager or supervisor shall threaten or imply that an employee's refusal\nto submit to sexual advances will adversely affect that person's\nemployment, compensation, advancement, assigned duties, or any other term\nor condition of employment or career development. Sexual joking, lewd\npictures and any conduct that tends to make employees of one gender \"sex\nobjects\" are prohibited.\n\n\n8.3 Policy for Resolving Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Complaints\n\nEmployees who have complaints of discrimination or harassment in violation\nof this policy should (and are encouraged to) report such complaints to a\nsupervisor. If an employee's supervisor is the cause of the offending\nconduct, or for any reason the employee is uncomfortable reporting such\ncomplaints directly to a supervisor, the employee may report this matter\ndirectly to the Compliance Officer or to any member of the Board of\nDirectors. The complaint will be promptly and thoroughly investigated.\nConfidentiality of reports and investigations of discrimination and\nharassment will be maintained to the greatest extent possible. Any manager,\nsupervisor, or employee who, after appropriate investigation, is found to\nhave engaged in discrimination against or harassment of another employee\nwill be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.\n\nIf any party directly involved in a discrimination or harassment\ninvestigation is dissatisfied with the outcome or resolution, that\nindividual has the right to appeal the decision to the full Board of\nDirectors. The dissatisfied party should submit his or her written comments\nto the Board President.\n\nThe Clear Fund will not in any way retaliate against any individual who\nmakes a report of discrimination or harassment nor permit any employee to\ndo so. Retaliation is a serious violation of this policy and should be\nreported immediately. Any person found to have retaliated against another\nindividual for reporting discrimination or harassment will be subject to\nappropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9.

The amendment amends\nArticle 3, Section 8, pertaining to regular meetings, in order to set the\nminimum number of official meetings per year at 3 rather than 4.\n\nWe intend to continue meeting at least four times per year, but due to the\ngeographic dispersion of our Directors, we seek as much flexibility as\npossible to have virtual meetings.  Reducing the number of required\nofficial meetings effectively reduces the number of required in-person\nmeetings, while still being in compliance with the Better Business Bureau's\nstandards for charity accountability.\n\nWe are also removing the language specifying the dates, times and locations\nof meetings and replacing it with \"at the Board's discretion,\" to reflect\nhow we schedule these meetings in practice.\n\n\nAmendment 2 – Regular meetings\n\n\nArticle 3, Section 8 is amended to read as follows.  (Changes from the\noriginal text are underlined.)\n\nRegular meetings of directors shall be held at the Board's discretion.  The\nfrequency of the meetings of directors may be no less than 3 meetings\nannually.\n\nA majority of the governing body members (at least 50%, on average) should\nbe in attendance. A conference call of the full board can substitute for\none of the three meetings of the governing body. Proxy attendance is not\ncounted for purposes of determining if the charity meets the above\nattendance requirement. For all meetings, alternative modes of\nparticipation are acceptable for those with physical disabilities.\n\nIf this corporation makes no provision for members, then, at the regular\nmeeting of directors held in June, directors shall be elected by the board\nof directors. The time of the election of the directors may be changed by\nan act of the board, but must have a specified time for election of\ndirectors at one scheduled board meeting annually. Voting for the election\nof directors shall be by written ballot. Each director shall cast one vote\nper candidate, and may vote for as many candidates as the number of\ncandidates to be elected to the board. The candidates receiving the highest\nnumber of votes up to the number of directors to be elected shall be\nelected to serve on the board. Board members not attending may vote\nelectronically by emailing their vote to the chairperson of the board.\n"

In the case of noncompliance,  we  may  grant\n      more to one charity than the other, but in any case will disburse  all\n      of the funds to some combination of the  two  charities  within  three\n      weeks.\n    • Make other recommendations to our  donor-advised  fund  based  on  the\n      preferences of other donors who gave  to  the  fund,  consistent  with\n      http://givewell.net/givewell-advance-donation\n\n\n\n                             Funds to be granted\n\n\n\nRestricted funds\n\n\nAs of 6/30/09, we have received $320,817.20 in contributions  earmarked  for\nregranting to recommended charities from our 2008-2009 report.\n\n$250,000 of this  is  earmarked  specifically  for  a  grant  to  a  charity\nfocusing on economic empowerment in sub-Saharan  Africa.   As  discussed  in\nAttachment B, we are not yet ready to make this grant.\n\nThe remaining $70,817.20 should be granted to outstanding charities as  soon\nas possible.\n\n\nUnrestricted funds\n\n\nAs of 6/30/09,  our  unrestricted  reserves  exceed  \"needed  reserves\"  (as\ndefined  in  section  10.3  of  our  Policies  Manual,  Attachment   D)   by\n$14,229.90.  (See Attachment A for details).\n\n\nDonor-advised fund\n\n\nIn 2008, we donated $25,000 to our donor-advised fund  (this  was  necessary\nin order to open the account).  Net of taxes and fees,  the  value  of  this\ninvestment is currently $25,047.89.\n\nOther funds in our donor-advised fund (whose holdings  total  $40,557.47  as\nof 6/30/09) are attributable to outside donors, who hope to  advise  on  the\ndistribution of funds as specified at  http://givewell.net/givewell-advance-\ndonation\n\n\n                             Choice of Charities\n\n\nAs explained  at  http://www.givewell.net/node/447,  we  have  significantly\nmore confidence in VillageReach and the Stop Tuberculosis  Partnership  than\nin any other charity.\n\nWe feel that making a decision between these  two  would  be  difficult  and\nunnecessary and propose to split the designated funds between  them,  though\nwe request approval for tying receipt of funds to basic conditions still  to\nbe determined by staff.  If one of  these  charities  fails  to  meet  these\nconditions, we may grant all or most of our funds to the other; however,  we\nwill disburse all of our funds to some combination of the two  within  three\nweeks.\n"

We are truthful in our broadcast, print and direct mail advertising,\n      using actual, current case histories and photography with honest\n      statements of purpose. We neither minimize nor overstate the human\n      needs of those whom we and/or our reviewed charities assist.\n\n   3. We are committed to spending the maximum amount of available resources\n      for the purposes for which they were given.\n\n   4. We will neither sell nor exchange, with any other agency or commercial\n      enterprise, the information of sponsors and contributors on our\n      mailing lists.\n       \n   5.

We refuse to engage in fundraising methods that are intimidating,\n      harassing or misleading, that are not subject to adequate control, or\n      that create an undue sense of obligation such as mailing unsolicited\n      merchandise or canisters; paid canvassing; telephone solicitation to\n      the general public; combining appeals with commercial sales which do\n      not define specific benefits to the agency; conducting misleading\n      campaigns or events; and paying for or making use of insincere\n      endorsements.\n\n   7.

We are governed by a Board of Directors, serving without compensation,\n      operating under bylaws ensuring adequate voting trusteeship, and whose\n      members have no financial or other conflict of interest with the goals\n      of the organization.

It states that it\nis illegal to retaliate against a “whistleblower.”  It is in an\norganization’s best interest to have a policy that provides clear\nprocedures for handling whistleblower complaints.  Proper handling of such\ncomplaints will help protect organizations from being accused of\nretaliation against whistleblowers.  Such a policy, to be effective, must\nbe circulated to all employees and board members.  It is recommended the\nBoard review and adopt a Whistleblower Policy.\n\n           General\n\nThe Clear Fund’s Code of Ethics and Conduct (“Code”) requires directors,\nofficers and employees to observe high standards of business and personal\nethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. As employees\nand representatives of The Clear Fund, we must practice honesty and\nintegrity in fulfilling our responsibilities and comply with all applicable\nlaws and regulations.\n\n           Reporting Responsibility\n\nIt is the responsibility of all directors, officers and employees to comply\nwith the Code and to report violations or suspected violations in\naccordance with this Whistleblower Policy.\n\n           No Retaliation\n\nNo director, officer or employee who in good faith reports a violation of\nthe Code shall suffer harassment, retaliation or adverse employment\nconsequence. An employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a\nviolation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including\ntermination of employment. This Whistleblower Policy is intended to\nencourage and enable employees and others to raise serious concerns within\nThe Clear Fund prior to seeking resolution outside the agency.\n\n           Reporting Violations\n\nThe Code addresses The Clear Fund’s open door policy and suggests that\nemployees share their questions, concerns, suggestions or complaints with\nsomeone who can address them properly. In most cases, an employee’s\nsupervisor is in the best position to address an area of concern. However,\nif you are not comfortable speaking with your supervisor or you are not\nsatisfied with your supervisor’s response, you are encouraged to speak with\nanyone in management or on the Board of Directors whom you are comfortable\nin approaching. Supervisors and managers are required to report suspected\nviolations of the Code of Conduct to The Clear Fund’s Compliance Officer,\nwho has specific and exclusive responsibility to investigate all reported\nviolations. For suspected fraud, or when you are not satisfied or\nuncomfortable with following The Clear Fund’s open door policy, individuals\nshould contact The Clear Fund’s Compliance Officer directly.\n\n           Compliance Officer\n\nThe Clear Fund’s Compliance Officer is responsible for investigating and\nresolving all reported complaints and allegations concerning violations of\nthe Code and, at his discretion, shall advise the Executive Director and/or\nthe Executive Committee. The Compliance Officer has direct access to the\nExecutive Committee of the board of directors and is required to report to\nthe Executive Committee at least annually on compliance activity.\n\n           Accounting and Auditing Matters\n\nThe Executive Committee of the board of directors shall address all\nreported concerns or complaints regarding accounting practices, internal\ncontrols or auditing. The Compliance Officer shall immediately notify the\nExecutive Committee of any such complaint and work with the committee until\nthe matter is resolved.\n\n           Acting in Good Faith\n\nAnyone filing a complaint concerning a violation or suspected violation of\nthe Code must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds for\nbelieving the information disclosed indicates a violation of the Code. Any\nallegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been\nmade maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious\ndisciplinary offense.\n\n           Confidentiality\n\nViolations or suspected violations may be submitted on a confidential basis\nby the complainant or may be submitted anonymously. Reports of violations\nor suspected violations will be kept confidential to the extent possible,\nconsistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.\n\n           Handling of Reported Violations\n\nThe Compliance Officer will notify the sender and acknowledge receipt of\nthe reported violation or suspected violation within five business days.\nAll reports will be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective action\nwill be taken if warranted by the investigation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8.

We value diversity and are willing to employ men and\nwomen of all ethnic and racial groups, ranging in age from the teens to the\nsixties and older, and representing a broad spectrum of religions and\nnational origins.  The company will make every reasonable effort to\naccommodate those physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified\nemployee, unless undue hardship would result for the company.\n\nJust as the company bears a responsibility towards this policy, each of us\nmust clearly communicate our disinterest in, or offense taken to, any\nperceived verbal or physical discrimination or harassment.  We are all\nresponsible for upholding this Equal Employment Opportunity policy and\ncommitment.  Equal Employment Opportunity laws afford each one of us the\nchance to succeed or fail based on individual merit.\n\n                        8.2 Sexual Harassment Policy\n\nThe Clear Fund prohibits sexual harassment of its employees and applicants\nfor employment by any employee, non-employee or applicant. Such conduct may\nresult in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. This policy\ncovers all employees. The Clear Fund will not tolerate, condone or allow\nsexual harassment, whether engaged in by fellow employees, supervisors,\nassociates, clients or other non-employees who conduct business with the\nClear Fund.\n\nSexual harassment is any behavior that includes unwelcome sexual advances\nand other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n\n• submission to, or rejection of, such conduct is used as the basis for\npromotions or other employment decisions;\n\n• the conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's job performance\nor creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.\n\nClear Fund employees are entitled to work in an environment free from\nsexual harassment and a hostile or offensive working environment. We\nrecognize sexual harassment as unlawful discrimination, just as conduct\nthat belittles or demeans any individual on the basis of race, religion,\nnational origin, sexual preference, age, disability, or other similar\ncharacteristics or circumstances.\n\nNo manager or supervisor shall threaten or imply that an employee's refusal\nto submit to sexual advances will adversely affect that person's\nemployment, compensation, advancement, assigned duties, or any other term\nor condition of employment or career development. Sexual joking, lewd\npictures and any conduct that tends to make employees of one gender \"sex\nobjects\" are prohibited.\n\n\n  8.3 Policy for Resolving Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Complaints\n\nEmployees who have complaints of discrimination or harassment in violation\nof this policy should (and are encouraged to) report such complaints to a\nsupervisor. If an employee's supervisor is the cause of the offending\nconduct, or for any reason the employee is uncomfortable reporting such\ncomplaints directly to a supervisor, the employee may report this matter\ndirectly to the Compliance Officer or to any member of the Board of\nDirectors. The complaint will be promptly and thoroughly investigated.\nConfidentiality of reports and investigations of discrimination and\nharassment will be maintained to the greatest extent possible. Any manager,\nsupervisor, or employee who, after appropriate investigation, is found to\nhave engaged in discrimination against or harassment of another employee\nwill be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.\n\nIf any party directly involved in a discrimination or harassment\ninvestigation is dissatisfied with the outcome or resolution, that\nindividual has the right to appeal the decision to the full Board of\nDirectors. The dissatisfied party should submit his or her written comments\nto the Board President.\n\nThe Clear Fund will not in any way retaliate against any individual who\nmakes a report of discrimination or harassment nor permit any employee to\ndo so. Retaliation is a serious violation of this policy and should be\nreported immediately. Any person found to have retaliated against another\nindividual for reporting discrimination or harassment will be subject to\nappropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\n\n"

          "text": "\nGiveWell Board Meeting – December 29, 2009\n\n                                   Summary\n\nThe focus of this meeting is voting to distribute $250,000 in funds to\neconomic-empowerment organizations in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWe recommend the following:\n\n    • $100,000 to the Small Enterprise Foundation, a microfinance\n      institution in South Africa\n    • $100,000 to the Village Enterprise Fund, a charity that distributes\n      cash (not loans) and provides business training to extremely poor\n      individuals in East Africa\n    • $50,000 to BRAC, a large Bangladesh-based development organization\n      that is currently expanding to Uganda, Tanzania, and other countries\n      in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThese recommendations are based on the following:\n\n    • We have not found an economic empowerment charity that is as strong on\n      our main criteria as any of our health-focused charities\n      (http://www.givewell.net/charities/top-charities). The three charities\n      above are all between 1 and 2 stars on our rating scale. This means\n      that we have at least one significant concern about each of the\n      organizations.\n    • We don’t believe there are significant, predictable differences in\n      future impact between the three. We keep the following in mind when\n      determining grant sizes:\n         o All appear to be able to incorporate the amount we plan to grant\n           (i.e., they can use additional money to scale their current\n           activities)\n         o We want to reward organizations for a commitment to critical\n           evaluation of their programs. We therefore believe it’s better\n           to reward more rather than fewer organizations, as long as the\n           amounts given are large enough to serve as a reward.\n         o Other things equal, we think it is reasonable to favor smaller\n           organizations rather than larger ones, where our funding and\n           recommendations are more likely to create the direct incentives\n           for the organizations to improve over time.\n\nBelow we provide:\n\n    • More detailed summaries of each organization’s strengths and\n      weaknesses\n    • An overview of the process we used to identify and filter\n      organizations\n\n                           Organization summaries\n\nMicrofinance institutions\n\nWe believe that microfinance can help people by giving them capital to\nstart or expand a business or just enable them to manage unpredictable\nincomes and expenses (e.g., medical bills, funerals). But, it can also harm\nthem if people take on more debt than they can reasonably manage.\n\nIn looking for a microfinance institution, we tried to determine whether\nthere was a strong case that loans an institution provided were (a) serving\npeople in need and (b) helping rather than harming its borrowers. We did\nthis by asking the following questions:\n\n    • Are the clients served poor? Microfinance institutions may choose to\n      serve wealthier borrowers to increase the likelihood that they can\n      become profitable.  (See also http://blog.givewell.net/?p=476)\n    • Do clients repay loans? The higher the repayment rate, the greater the\n      extent to which participation can be interpreted as \"paying customers\"\n      rather than as \"receiving handouts.\"\n    • Are interest rates competitive (i.e., reasonably high)?  This also\n      pertains to the \"paying customer\" vs. \"receiving handouts\" question.\n    • Do clients frequently drop out (and if so, why)?  This gets somewhat\n      at the question of whether clients are \"overborrowing\" – see\n      discussion at http://blog.givewell.net/?p=500\n    • Can the bank effectively use more funds? We hope to support a bank\n      that needs donations to continue to offer more/better financial\n      services to clients.\n\nMore at our blog series on microfinance: http://blog.givewell.net/?cat=34\n\nSmall Enterprise Foundation\n\n    • Who are SEF’s clients? It appears that they are poor.  SEF has shared\n      an internal evaluation using what we consider a strong methodology and\n      showing that most clients lack basic amenities (e.g., flush toilet,\n      electric power).  It has also shared an external check that we\n      consider more difficult to interpret.\n    • Do SEF’s clients repay loans? Yes, the “true” repayment rate is over\n      96% over the past 3 years.\n    • Are SEF's interest rates competitive (i.e., reasonably high)? SEF\n      clients repay loans at relatively high rates of interest.\n    • Do SEF's clients frequently drop out (and if so, why)? Clients drop\n      out at rates of 15-25% per year. SEF surveys clients on the reasons\n      they drop out and the most common reasons relate to dissatisfaction\n      with the program. Based on the data we’ve reviewed, these rates appear\n      to be roughly average among institutions that report dropout rates\n      (see http://blog.givewell.net/?p=500)\n    • Room for more funds? SEF is not yet profitable and uses donations to\n      support their operations.  It projects an operational deficit of\n      $222,000 over the next 12 months.\n    • Other considerations:\n         o SEF demonstrates the strongest commitment to monitoring and\n           evaluation of any MFI we reviewed. They:\n               ▪ Have completed multiple surveys of clients to assess\n                 their standard of living.\n               ▪ Survey program dropouts on  the reasons they drop out.\n                 (They don’t just track the number that drop out.)\n         o They have been been given a \"Social rating\" by M-CRIL, an\n           independent microfinance ratings organization (M-CRIL would not\n           give us information on how frequently they do ratings and how\n           often they hand out each score, but from what we've seen of\n           publicly posted ratings, external \"Social ratings\" are fairly\n           rare.)  The rating states, \"In a ‘middle-income country’ which\n           has substantial consumer lending to salaried workers, SEF is the\n           leading example of poverty focused microfinance, emphasising\n           micro-credit for enterprise and women’s self-employment. SEF\n           demonstrates strong commitment to the double bottom line,  and\n           in a difficult economic environment is quite effectively\n           balancing financial performance and excellent portfolio quality\n           with targeted poverty outreach and innovative social monitoring\n           mechanisms.\"  Rating components include:\n               ▪ Clarity and social-impact focus of stated\n                 mission/strategy.\n               ▪ Targeting of the poor.\n               ▪ Appropriateness and social-impact focus of staff\n                 training; staff salary incentives (which are significant\n                 and incorporate growth in borrowing groups, portfolio\n                 quality and retention rates)\n               ▪ Information systems for tracking client retention rates\n                 and financial situations\n               ▪ Transparency, and client awareness, of product terms\n               ▪ Policies and procedures for death/illness; auditing of\n                 compliance\n               ▪ Mention of a partnership on a gender empowerment program\n                 that showed encouraging results in a randomized controlled\n                 trial\n               ▪ Representation of women on SEF's staff\\(64% overall).\n               ▪ Client satisfaction (~70% positive on most questions)\n               ▪ Client use of other credit sources (clients often use\n                 informal lending societies but rarely use moneylenders or\n                 other MFIs)\n               ▪ Loose analysis of trends in client incomes/outcomes (\"The\n                 data indicates a certain level of change which is overall\n                 positive – but lacks a reference to define how significant\n                 the change is, and does not account for dropouts between\n                 cycles\")\n\nThe charts below summarize the basic facts for SEF: (revenues and expenses,\ntotal portfolio size)\n\n[pic]\n\n[pic]\n\n\n\nNote: SEF is a registered non-profit in South Africa, but not a U.S.-\nregistered 501(c)(3).  We believe we will be able to find a fairly simple\nway to grant SEF while complying with our charter.  If not, we wish to\nreserve the option of dividing the funds allocated to SEF proportionately\nbetween VEF and BRAC (i.e., 2/3 to VEF and 1/3 to BRAC).\n\nCash grants and business mentoring programs\n\nCash grants seem to us like the most direct way to help extremely poor\nindividuals: provide them with money so they can use it as they wish.\n\nWhile direct cash grants may not be particularly cost-effective, we feel\nthat the burden of proof should be on other economic empowerment programs\nto show that, essentially, they're doing more for their clients than the\nclients could do for themselves.  As far as we can tell, no economic\nempowerment charities seem able to demonstrate a strong track record, and\ngiven this situation we think funding cash grants is reasonable.\n\nIn the case of cash grants, we consider the following:\n\n    • What is the standard of living of recipients? It’s very important that\n      recipients are poor. This is an intervention in which the incentive\n      for non-poor individuals to try to receive funds is high.\n    • What is the “cash grant ratio” for granting organizations? By “cash\n      grant ratio” we mean: what percentage of expenses does an organization\n      regrant as cash. We prefer that the cost of distributing cash be low.\n      Programs we’ve reviewed range from 15% of expenses distributed as\n      grants to 40%.\n    • Especially if other services are provided, is there direct evidence of\n      impact on clients' standards of living?\n\nVillage Enterprise Fund\n\nVEF provides small grants ($30) to each of five members in a business\ngroup. VEF also provides training to help participants run their\nbusinesses.\n\nVEF grants total approximately 35% of its revenues.\n\nVEF thoroughly monitors their program:\n    • They record the standard of living of participants\n    • They monitor the change in standard of living for a subset of\n      participants\n\nConcerns:\n    • VEF places a lot of power in the hands of “business mentors” (BMs).\n      BMs are local individuals – often more powerful and wealthier – who\n      make the decisions about who receives funds. This creates a situation\n      where BMs could agree to select certain individuals for the program as\n      long as those individuals agree to “kickback” some portion of the\n      grant. While VEF appears to have a relatively strong system to ensure\n      that BMs distribute all the funds, they do not appear to have a\n      mechanism to prevent BMs from collecting kickbacks, and VEF reported\n      some anecdotes that kickbacks have taken place.\n\n[pic]\n\n[pic]\n[pic]\n\n\nBRAC\n\nBRAC is a large (~$420 million in expenses) development organization based\nin Bangladesh, currently expanding into Sub-Saharan Africa. Because of its\nsize and diverse activities, we haven’t evaluated the organization as a\nwhole. Nevertheless, we think BRAC stands out from the rest of the field in\nthe following ways:\n\n    • It has one program, The Ultra Poor Program (TUP), that is the\n      strongest cash transfer program we’ve reviewed.  This program accounts\n      for about 10% of BRAC's expenses.\n         o The program’s “cash grant ratio” is 40%\n         o The program makes a strong case for impact (on participants'\n           standards of living), not just wealth transfer\n         o The program is now being scaled up and evaluated by Innovators\n           for Poverty Action, a program evaluation group based at Yale and\n           associated with MIT’s Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL). More on our\n           view of IPA at\n           http://www.givewell.net/international/technical/criteria/program-\n           evaluation#JPALandIPA\n    • BRAC has a strong reputation among on-the-ground organizations and\n      others whom we respect\n         o A representative of VisionSpring stated to us that \"BRAC is a\n           great partner because they're highly organized, they have a\n           great reputation, and they have a lot of infrastructure to be\n           able to roll out a program like this.  They're sort of top of\n           the line in terms of partners – but there's really only one\n           BRAC.  Our goal is to find organizations that are as much like\n           them as possible.\"  (See\n           http://groups.yahoo.com/group/givewell/message/95)\n         o We also understand that at least two other organizations have\n           chosen to partner with BRAC for similar reasons: LivingGoods (a\n           charity we have a reasonably high opinion - see\n           http://www.givewell.net/international/charities/special-\n           recognition#LivingGoods) and Seva Mandir (when conducting a\n           randomized evaluation of cash incentives for immunizations).\n    • BRAC has a strong commitment to monitoring and evaluation as evidenced\n      by its website at www.bracresearch.org, a site on which it regularly\n      publishes research reviewing its programs. We identified and reviewed\n      the TUP program (discussed above) based solely on information freely\n      available on BRAC’s website and the BRAC Research site\n\nThat said, we are not highly confident in BRAC.  Its microfinance programs\nhave what we could call \"average\" reporting, which is insufficient to\nanswer our major concerns about microfinance programs.  We have not\ninvestigated its other programs: starting social businesses (which BRAC\nasserts are self-supporting), health programs, and education programs.\n\nThe charts below provide an overview of BRAC’s financials as well as\nexpense allocation to its different program areas.\n\n(Note: data came from two different sources so we don’t have financials for\n2003-2004.)\n\n[pic]\n\n[pic]\n\n                           Overview of our process\n\nWe tried to cast the net as wide as we could to consider any organization\nthat could potentially receive our grant. We considered a total of 485\norganizations.\n\nWe found organizations by:\n\n    • Reviewing any economic empowerment organization we had considered for\n      our international research report\n    • Reviewing all charities listed as international economic development\n      on Charity Navigator\n    • Reviewing all charities with an activity code of “Q30” International\n      development according to their IRS Form 990 with budgets of at least\n      $1m.\n    • We also published news of the grant on our blog and found some\n      organizations through a variety of other sources\n\nTo review applicants, we sought an organization that could demonstrate one\nof the following. Any organization that met any of these criteria was\nflagged for further investigation:\n\n   A. Primarily transferring cash/loans directly to poor individuals\n   B. Could demonstrate that it was using donations to create profitable\n      programs\n   C. Could provide a rigorous impact study demonstrating program effect\n   D. Microfinance program that could answer the questions about\n      microfinance outlined above\n\nVEF and SEF met criterion A; BRAC met criterion C; SEF met criterion D.\nOther organizations that met one or more of these criteria, or that we have\nsubstantial other notes on:\n\n    • Large U.S. microfinance organizations. Grameen Foundation, ACCION\n      International, Opportunity International, Women's World Banking,\n      Unitus. We rejected them for two reasons: (a) they largely provide\n      technical assistance as opposed to directly funding MFIs. They did not\n      provide support to demonstrate that their assistance was having an\n      impact. (More at http://blog.givewell.net/?p=464). (b) They could not\n      provide answers to our microfinance questions listed above.\n    • Heifer International. They provided us with (confidential) impact\n      reports. After reviewing them carefully and discussing them at length\n      with Heifer staff we concluded that we did not find these reports\n      compelling.\n    • Women for Women International. Largely distributes cash. A few major\n      issues:\n         o “Cash grant ratio” is ~15%, far worse than that of VEF or BRAC\n         o They give the same size grants in all locations they work\n           ($10/month) whether it’s wealthier (Kosovo) or poorer (rural\n           Rwanda). We asked but could not determine the logic behind this.\n         o They try to serve as many women in a community as possible. This\n           means that they are distributing funds on the same day to many\n           women in one relatively narrow geographical area. We’re\n           concerned that this could easily cause other distortions in the\n           local economy (such as higher prices to compensate for the large\n           influx of funds) which could offset the impact of distributing\n           the cash.\n    • Microloan Foundation. Only other MFI that provided a calculation of\n      the “real” repayment rate and had surveyed clients to determine\n      reasons for exiting. That said, we found them to be a weaker applicant\n      than SEF in the following ways:\n         o In 2006, MLF’s \"repayment rate\" was relatively low (around 80%).\n           We use scare quotes for \"repayment rate\" because we have serious\n           questions about what this statistic means (see\n           http://blog.givewell.net/?p=501).  MLF did send us what we\n           consider the “real” repayment rate, but only since Q3 2007. SEF\n           sent us this data for its entire history (back to 1992) and its\n           repayment rate has remained high for a significant period of\n           time.\n         o SEF’s surveys client’s reasons for dropping out consistently and\n           systematically. MLF did a one-time survey of 31 clients.\n         o We are not entirely convinced that MFL’s reported repayment rate\n           can be taken at face value. It seems plausible that this does\n           not include all of the non-repaid loans.\n\nBackground on process – how we found charities and number that applied\n\n|How we found them                 |Number of Organizations           |\n|Q30                               |311                               |\n|MFI on MixMarket                  |45                                |\n|Main Report                       |24                                |\n|Found us                          |3                                 |\n|Charity Navigator                 |49                                |\n|Fast Company                      |3                                 |\n|NTEE q32                          |39                                |\n|Gates                             |6                                 |\n|Unsure (MFN and Global Partners   |2                                 |\n|for Development)                  |                                  |\n|Total                             |437                               |\n\n\n       \nWe ultimately directly invited 197 organizations to apply.

There  were  no\n      other expenses over 12/1-12/2.  Thus, we  include  12/1-12/2  expenses\n      even though the budget is conceptually for the period through November\n      2009.\n    • Grants approved at the July meeting (and paid subsequently) are listed\n      under the 1-6/2009 heading.  Grants approved at this meeting (and paid\n      subsequently) will be associated with the 7-11/2009 time period.   All\n      other expenses are associated  with  the  dates  at  which  they  were\n      actually paid.\n    • Some minor discrepancies are due to the way  the  7-12/09  budget  was\n      approved  (month-by-month).   For  example,  \"accounting  costs\"  were\n      totaled for the year and approved on a month-by-month basis,  but  the\n      lump sum for the audit was not paid over this period (it will be  paid\n      this month).  There is a similar issue with insurance (we  approved  a\n      \"per-month\" allowance  but  paid  the  entire  annual  fee  over  this\n      period).\n    • We have switched insurance providers.  Our new policy is substantially\n      more  expensive  but  substantially  clearer  in  its  coverage,   and\n      accompanied by substantially better service.  We now  also  break  out\n      workers' compensation and  disability  benefits  insurance  separately\n      from salaries/benefits.\n    • There are minor discrepancies between the \"Actual\" reported here for 1-\n      6/09  and  the  \"Actual\"  reported  at  the   July   meeting.    These\n      discrepancies will be  resolved  with  the  help  of  our  accountant.\n      Expenses reported here exceed expenses reported at the July meeting by\n      $640.57 of salaries & benefits, $24.16 of  misc  admin/pledge-raising,\n      and $35.82 of accounting/bookkeeping.\n                   Projected budget: 12/1/2009-11/30/2010\n                             (Excluding grants)\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n                             Available reserves\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n                               Proposed grants\n\n    • Our \"excess  reserves  policy\"  is  not  currently  triggered.   Funds\n      available for operating costs  exceed  anticipated  12mo  expenses  by\n      $141,185.49.  This amount would not be enough to  cover  the  next  12\n      months by conservative assumptions (for example,  assuming  that  2011\n      expenses will be in the same range as 2010's).\n    • $250,000 of our reserves are restricted for the  economic  empowerment\n      grant discussed at this meeting.  We recommend that it be  distributed\n      as proposed in Attachment A.\n    • $34,813.40 of current and anticipated reserves are  restricted  to  be\n      regranted to top charities at our discretion.  We  propose  that  this\n      sum  be  divided  between  our  current   two   top-rated   charities:\n      VillageReach and the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership.\n\n"

Allow 90 minutes.  See\n   Attachment A.\n\n\nWe recommend the following:\n\n    • $100,000 to the Small Enterprise Foundation, a microfinance\n      institution in South Africa\n    • $100,000 to the Village Enterprise Fund, a charity that distributes\n      cash (not loans) and provides business training to extremely poor\n      individuals in East Africa\n    • $50,000 to BRAC, a large Bangladesh-based development organization\n      that is currently expanding to Uganda, Tanzania, and other countries\n      in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThese recommendations are based on the following:\n\n    • We have not found an economic empowerment charity that is as strong on\n      our main criteria as any of our health-focused charities\n      (http://www.givewell.net/charities/top-charities). The three charities\n      above are all between 1 and 2 stars on our rating scale. This means\n      that we have at least one significant concern about each of the\n      organizations.\n    • We don’t believe there are significant, predictable differences in\n      future impact between the three. We keep the following in mind when\n      determining grant sizes:\n         o All appear to be able to incorporate the amount we plan to grant\n           (i.e., they can use additional money to scale their current\n           activities)\n         o We want to reward organizations for a commitment to critical\n           evaluation of their programs. We therefore believe it’s better\n           to reward more rather than fewer organizations, as long as the\n           amounts given are large enough to serve as a reward.\n         o Other things equal, we think it is reasonable to favor smaller\n           organizations rather than larger ones, where our funding and\n           recommendations are more likely to create the direct incentives\n           for the organizations to improve over time.\n\n3. Budget review and allocation of other grants.  Allow 30 minutes.  See\n   Attachment B.\n\nOur reserves are more than sufficient for the next 12 months of expenses,\n   but not at the level that would trigger our \"excess reserves\" policy.\n\nWe recommend that $34,813.40 in restricted assets be divided evenly between\n   VillageReach and the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership.\n\n\n                    Total projected meeting time: 2 hours\n\nAttachments:\n   A.

          "text": "\n                   GiveWell Executive-compensation Review\n\nWe propose a cost-of-living raise for Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld\nand review the data we relied upon to prepare this proposal.\n\nProposal\n\nElie Hassenfeld and Holden Karnofsky, GiveWell’s co-Executive Directors,\nare currently each paid $65,000 per year (plus health benefits). We propose\na $2,500 cost-of-living increase in their salaries (to $67,500 plus health\nbenefits) based on inflation since June 2007.[1]\n\nWe believe that this salary is commensurate with our output and within the\nrange of reasonable compensation for GiveWell’s executives (based on the\nexecutive compensation at other, similar organizations) and survey data.\n\nBackground\n\nGiveWell’s Board of Directors set salaries for Elie Hassenfeld and Holden\nKarnfosky in June 2007. In September 2008, GiveWell’s Board approved a\nbudget with the same salaries without a full review along these lines.\n\nGiveWell data\n\n    • Total expenses: In 2009, GiveWell had total expenses of $200,000-\n      $250,000 (exact number to follow in the budget board-meeting\n      attachment). GiveWell also tracked over $1 million in donations to\n      GiveWell-recommended charities due to GiveWell’s recommendations. We\n      believe it’s appropriate to consider GiveWell’s “money moved” when\n      comparing our budget size to the size of other grantmakers and\n      organizations focused on improving the philanthropic sector.\n    • In December 2009-January 2010, givewell.net had an average of 23,500\n      unique visitors each month.\n    • Elie Hassenfeld and Holden Karnofsky, GiveWell co-Executive Directors,\n      each earn $65,000 per year.\n\nComparable organizations\n\nWe have identified the three organizations below as the most comparable\norganizations to GiveWell for which data is available. None of these\norganizations is perfectly comparable to GiveWell in either size or focus.\n\nAmerican Institute of Philanthropy. According to its website, “The American\nInstitute of Philanthropy (AIP) is a nationally prominent charity watchdog\nservice whose purpose is to help donors make informed giving decisions.”\nThe AIP publishes “the triannual Charity Rating Guide included in the\nCharity Watchdog Report, informs donors about how over 500 national\ncharities spend your money and keeps donors up to date on current issues\nrelated to charitable giving.”\n\n    • According to its 2008 IRS Form 990, AIP had a budget of $437,650 in\n      2008.\n    • According to Compete.com, charitywatch.org (the AIP’s website) had\n      76,000 and 87,000 unique visitors in December 2009 and January 2010,\n      respectively. This is approximately 3-4x the traffic givewell.net\n      received over the same period.\n    • According to its 2008 IRS Form 990, AIP’s Executive Director earned\n      $119,331 (+20,485 to other compensation) in 2008.\n\nRoot Cause.  According to its website, “Root Cause is a research and\nconsulting firm dedicated to mobilizing the nonprofit, public, and business\nsectors to work together in a new social impact market.”  Like GiveWell,\nRoot Cause is a member of the Alliance for Effective Social Investing.\n\n    • According to its 2008 IRS Form 990, Root Cause had a budget of $3.2m\n      in 2008.\n    • According to Compete.com, rootcause.org gets very limited traffic\n      (less than 2,000 visitors per month).\n    • According to its 2008 IRS Form 990, Root Cause’s Executive Director\n      earned $136,483 in 2008.\n\nThe Third Wave Foundation. According to its website, “Third Wave is a\nfeminist, activist foundation that works nationally to support young women\nand transgender youth ages 15 to 30.

For each question,\nwe discuss\n    • Our progress over the last year (specifically, since our last business\n      plan in 11/2008);\n    • Where we stand (compared to where we eventually hope to be);\n    • What we can do to improve from here.\n\nDoes GiveWell provide quality research that highlights truly outstanding\ncharities in the areas it has covered?\n\nThis is in some ways the most difficult question for us to give a\nmeaningful answer on. “Quality” and “outstanding” are concepts that depend\na lot on your worldview, so when we review the research that we ourselves\nhave created, you can expect our opinion to be skewed toward the positive.\nThat said, we can discuss how our research compares to what we feel it\nwould ideally be.\nAt this point we are satisfied with the quality of our international aid\nreport, but see a need to cover more causes and to be more systematic about\ngetting meaningful critical feedback.\nProgress since 11/08\nAs of 11/08,\n    • We had published research on U.S. equality of opportunity and\n      international aid, but felt our research process had substantial room\n      for improvement (among other things, we felt it relied too much on the\n      arbitrariness of how charities responded to our grant application, and\n      that it didn’t make enough use of publicly available independent\n      analysis). We planned to “re-do” the cause of international aid, with\n      substantial changes to the process (see our June 2008 plan).\n    • We had essentially nothing in the way of critical feedback on our\n      research, aside from very high-level conversations about our\n      conclusions at Board meetings.\nSince then,\n    • We have published our 2008-2009 international aid report using our\n      revised methodology. We feel that we have found an appropriate way of\n      investigating charities without relying on grant applications and that\n      we have substantially improved on our prior recommendations (see\n      our top charities - the two three-star charities were found this year,\n      while the top charities from last year’s report have two-star\n      ratings). We feel that our revised methodology is the best we can do\n      with the resources and information available, and do not feel a need\n      to “re-do” our coverage of international aid (although we will need to\n      keep it up to date).\n    • We also completed a grant application process for economic\n      empowerment, whose results we will be publishing shortly.\n    • A small number of people have scrutinized our research in detail and\n      had in-depth conversations with us, partly in private and partly in\n      public. These include (a) Board member Jon Behar, with whom\n      we publicly discussed our reasoning for our two top-rated charities;\n      (b) Phil Steinmeyer and Ian Turner, both donors whom we had no pre-\n      GiveWell connection to and who put substantial time of their own into\n      this year’s giving decisions (In each case, a substantial amount was\n      ultimately allocated to our top-rated charity, VillageReach); (c) 5-10\n      other individual donors who have gone over much, though not all, of\n      our research and discussed it with us at length.\n    • We have also engaged in public conversation at a more general level\n      via our blog. There have been generally favorable reactions - though\n      these are not the same as endorsements - from people with substantial\n      experience and/or publications on foreign aid (including David\n      Roodman, Saundra Schimmelpfennig, Alanna Shaikh and Chris Blattman).\nWhere we stand\nInternally we are satisfied with the quality of our research, but:\n    • We need to add in direct observation of charities’ observations, to\n      the extent that we can.\n         o For international aid, it isn’t practical to get both deep and\n           representative field experience with each, or really any, of the\n           charities we review. Gaining truly representative up-close\n           experience with the operations of even a single small charity\n           (let alone one like PSI) could take years; gaining\n           representative up-close experience with several charities, for\n           the sake of comparative analysis, is in our view entirely\n           impractical (and so it is not surprising that no such\n           comparative analysis appears to exist).\n         o That said, at this point we have not visited a single developing-\n           world charity, and could potentially gain a lot from a site\n           visit.\n    • Our research needs more substantial external checks than it has gotten\n      to date. The only people who have scrutinized it in detail (as opposed\n      to discussing/linking to it at a general level) are, like ourselves,\n      outsiders in the field of international aid. Though people aware of\n      our research (including ourselves) generally seem to consider it high-\n      quality, it is important that we eventually subject it to strong,\n      critical scrutiny from people with substantial relevant experience and\n      credentials.\nWhat we can do to improve\n    • We can conduct site visits to one or more of our reviewed charities. I\n      am currently planning a trip to Africa from 2/10-2/23 during which I\n      will visit both VillageReach and the Small Enterprise Foundation.\n    • We can make a concerted effort to subject our research to strong,\n      critical scrutiny from people with substantial relevant experience and\n      credentials. The first basic step – which we haven’t yet taken – is\n      simply to systematically identify the people who are most likely to be\n      both qualified and willing to review our research, then make\n      persistent contact with them (both personally and through contacts of\n      ours) asking them specifically for in-depth reviews of our research.\n      If they decline, we’ll hopefully learn more about why they are\n      declining and what we can do to make reviewing our research more worth\n      their while.\n\nIs it practical for donors to evaluate and use GiveWell’s research in the\nareas it has covered?\n\nWe believe that our work has become substantially more usable and practical\nto engage with. The limited external checks on our research (discussed\nabove) are a major potential obstacle for donors to evaluate it.\nProgress since 11/08\nA year ago, the poor design of our website was a major potential obstacle\nfor donors seeking to understand our work. Phil Steinmeyer summarized the\nproblems in an email earlier this year. A donor who had the time and\ninclination could follow every step of our process, but otherwise had very\nlittle to go on besides a list of top charities and stories of our project\nfrom us and the media. Since then, we have:\n    • Substantially revamped our website (not just its design but its\n      organization).\n    • Made a concerted effort to “repackage” much of our research in\n      an extended series of blog posts. While our website focuses on\n      presenting our recommended charities and the process we followed to\n      identify them, these blog posts present (a subset of) our research\n      such that particular general-interest points can be followed without\n      having to read through a lot of other context. Comments on the blog\n      posts also can give context on how others view our research.\nWe have also made some progress in terms of giving donors ways to evaluate\nour credibility:\n    • We have made increased efforts to keep records of our conversations\n      with people who have substantial experience/credentials in\n      international aid, although this page is still rudimentary and not\n      enough output from the conversations is public.\n    • We have been featured in The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer, and\n      discussed our research extensively with Prof. Singer. As shown in our\n      metrics report, many of our donors come via referrals from Prof.\n      Singer, and they presumably see him as a trusted source; this is\n      relevant to their assessment of GiveWell’s credibility.\nWhere we stand\nA donor with the time and inclination can follow our full process,\nreasoning, and sources, and (as discussed above) a few that we know of have\nactually done so. A more casual donor has some, though limited, ways of\nassessing our research:\n    • Coming to us from a source they trust, such as Peter Singer.\n    • Spot-checking a particular claim we make on the website.\n    • Reading a sampling of our blog posts and the comments on them,\n      particularly the various responses from charities we have criticized.\n    • Viewing the limited records of our conversations with people who have\n      substantial experience/credentials in international aid.\nWe feel these options are insufficient on the whole, given our goal of\ninfluencing as many donors as possible. We feel that we should have a\nsingle, easy-to-find roundup of available information on the reliability of\ncredibility of our research.\nWhat we can do to improve\n    • We can make a concerted effort to subject our research to strong,\n      critical scrutiny from people with substantial relevant experience and\n      credentials, and to create public records of such scrutiny. (This is\n      also a key area for improvement in the previous section, “quality of\n      our research.” We feel that strong critical scrutiny would improve\n      both the actual quality of our research and donors’ abilities to gauge\n      its credibility.)\n    • We can put together the best possible consolidated case for the\n      credibility of our research.\n\nHas GiveWell covered enough areas to be useful?\n\nOur original business plan states:\nWe believe that pitting charities against each other using concrete,\nconsistent criteria is the best way to evaluate them in a way that is\nthorough and understandable to others. At the same time, we do not want to\ncompare all charities in the same terms, because this would involve making\nphilosophical decisions that should be made explicit rather than buried in\nconversion factors. We’ve therefore taken the approach of dividing\ncharities into causes by broad philosophical goal … Charities are pitted\ndirectly against each other within causes, but not between them.\nIn other words, while we sometimes argue for one broad cause over another,\nwe ultimately seek to serve donors with many different values. We are a\nlong way from accomplishing this goal.\nProgress since 11/08\nThe focus of the last year has been a report on international aid. The\nintent was to improve both our depth (i.e., quality of the research and top-\nrated charities) and our breadth (i.e., the number of “causes,” or\ndifferent value sets, we can make recommendations for). Our breadth did not\nimprove as much as we had hoped, because we concluded that health has by\nfar the strongest options for donors (and the charities we had previously\nrecommended were in the area of health). We have been able to make only\nweak recommendations foreducation and economic empowerment (although better\nrecommendations for the latter are forthcoming as a result of our recently\ncompleted grant application process ).\nWhere we stand\nCurrently, the only charities we recommend with two-star ratings or higher\nare in the areas of U.S. education (K-12), U.S. early childhood care, and\nglobal health. This is enough to serve some donors, but overall gives quite\na narrow set of options.\nWhat we can do to improve\nWe are considering research on areas including:\n    • More sub-causes within international aid - including disaster\n      relief/recovery, charities aiming to help orphans and vulnerable\n      children, and more attempts to find a strong microfinance option.\n    • U.S. equality of opportunity - our current research on this\n      cause comes from our original (2007-2008) research process. It should\n      be re-done with the revised research process we used to create our\n      current international aid report.\n    • Disease research funding (e.g., American Cancer Society).\n    • Environmental issues, particularly global warming mitigation.\nThere are many more charitable causes, but these are the ones we feel it\nwould be most productive to research in the relatively short term (more in\na future post).\n\nBottom line on GiveWell as a donor resource\n\n    • Our international aid report meets our internal quality standards, but\n      should be subjected to more systematic, in-depth, public scrutiny to\n      improve both its quality and the ability of casual donors to judge its\n      credibility.\n    • We feel that both our international aid report and our report on U.S.\n      equality of opportunity (which does not meet our internal quality\n      standards) are valuable resources for donors interested in those\n      causes, and more directly useful for impact-focused donors than any\n      other available resources.\n    • We offer a very narrow set of causes for donors and should research\n      many more areas.\n\nSelf-evaluation: GiveWell as a project\n\nThis post answers the “additional questions for stakeholders” that we posed\nto ourselves in January about the state of GiveWell. For each question, we\ndiscuss\n    • Our progress over the last year (specifically, since our last business\n      plan in 11/2008);\n    • Where we stand (compared to where we eventually hope to be);\n    • What we can do to improve from here.\n\nIs GiveWell’s research process “robust,” i.e., can it be continued and\nmaintained without relying on the co-Founders?\n\nProgress since 11/08\nAs of 11/08, we had only made one extended attempt to hire a third\nemployee, and had ended the relationship because our research process was\nnot developed enough to make it possible for us to provide the necessary\noversight (more).\nIn early 2009, we made several more unsuccessful attempts to integrate a\nnew hire into our research process, before again concluding that our\nprocess wasn’t developed enough. We tried again with more success in mid-\n2009, hiring:\n    • One person who stayed with us from May through December 2009, focusing\n      on our grant application process for economic empowerment, before\n      leaving for a job in consulting.\n    • Natalie Stone, who has now been with us since July 2009 and is charged\n      with maintaining and expanding our international aid report, by\n      reviewing charities along the criteria we have defined.\nDetails at our work plan review.\nWe feel that a key factor in being able to productively hire people has\nbeen the progress on our international aid report. We now have many\navailable examples of charity reviews and a consistent set of questions we\nask and criteria we use. We have thus been able to be more concrete with\nnew hires about their responsibilities and the expectations on them.\nWhere we stand\nWe feel that for the cause of international aid specifically, we are\napproaching the point where another person can maintain and expand the\nreport with little oversight from the co-Founders. However,\n    • This applies only to our international aid report. Covering more\n      causes will require heavy involvement from the co-Founders.\n    • The role of maintaining the international aid report is still not well-\n      defined enough that we feel it can be passed on from one person with a\n      given set of credentials and qualifications to another, reliably and\n      systematically. At this point we would stick to saying that Natalie\n      Stone can maintain it with relatively little oversight.\nIn short, our research process is not at all robust.\nWhat we can do to improve\nOur experience to date has been that hiring and training people (a)\ninvolves substantial time investment by the co-Founders; (b) can easily\nfail to add value to the organization; (c) is more likely to succeed when\nwe are able to be concrete rather than open-ended about employees’\nresponsibilities, which in turn requires that we have a well-defined\nresearch process (i.e., many available examples of charity reviews; a\nconsistent set of questions we ask and criteria we use). With that in mind:\n    • We can research more causes. We expect research on new causes to be\n      initially open-ended and improvisational (as past research has been),\n      but we also expect to gradually produce more consistent criteria,\n      rules of thumb, and examples, with which we can train others to do the\n      research.\n    • We can continue hiring people and training them by slotting them into\n      our research process, where we have well-defined enough\n      responsibilities to make this work.\n    • We can attempt to make our process more formal, to the point where\n      much of what people need to know is captured in writing and as little\n      as possible relies on specific people. We feel at this point that work\n      in this area would be premature. As we work to train new hires, we\n      learn more about how to communicate and formalize our process.\n\nDoes GiveWell present its research in a way that is likely to be persuasive\nand impactful (i.e., is GiveWell succeeding at “packaging” its research)?\n\nProgress since 11/08\nA year ago, it was extremely difficult for donors even to understand our\nwork, much less engage with it. We have put significant effort into\nimproving the clarity, organization and credibility of our research, and\nour efforts/progress on this front are discussed in our previous post under\nthe heading of ” Is it practical for donors to evaluate and use GiveWell’s\nresearch in the areas it has covered?”\nWe have not put effort into making our research more emotionally appealing,\npsychologically persuasive, etc.\nWhere we stand\nOur current content aims for clarity over persuasiveness. We feel that our\nclarity is now reasonably strong (as discussed in our previous post under\nthe heading of ” Is it practical for donors to evaluate and use GiveWell’s\nresearch in the areas it has covered?”) But our presentation remains dry,\nmaking next to no attempts at emotional engagement.\nWhat we can do to improve\n    • We can make a concerted effort to “repackage” our existing content,\n      presenting the same ideas in more emotionally compelling ways. Such an\n      effort would involve thinking and working in very different ways from\n      what we’ve spent our time on to date, and may require substantial\n      involvement from people who are more focused on, experienced with and\n      skilled in communications than anyone on our current staff.\n    • A lower-cost, “low-hanging fruit” version of the above option is to\n      put more effort into integrating ourmain website with our blog - we\n      have created a lot of content on the blog, much of which is not\n      duplicated in any way on the main website and is interesting/engaging\n      in ways that the main website is not.\n    • We can obtain and collect endorsements from people whose support\n      donors are likely to find meaningful. Doing so would overlap heavily\n      with the activities described in our previous post under the heading\n      of ” Is it practical for donors to evaluate and use GiveWell’s\n      research in the areas it has covered?”\n\nDoes GiveWell reach a lot of potential customers (i.e., is GiveWell\nsucceeding at “marketing” its research)?\n\nProgress since 11/08\nOur metrics file shows that traffic to our site has grown significantly\nover the past year. Several factors have likely contributed to the\nimprovement, and it is difficult (and in our view not necessary) to break\ndown the improvement between them:\n    • Peter Singer’s featuring GiveWell in The Life You Can\n      Save and continually promoting it\n    • Substantial revamping of our website\n    • Intensified posting to our blog during giving season\n    • The simple value of having been visible for another year\nWhere we stand\nOur website traffic is still a fraction of the traffic commanded by two\nother donor resources, Charity Navigator and GuideStar, and our research is\nnot used in any significant “partnerships.” Our impact remains small.\nWhat we can do to improve\nThere are many possible strategies for expanding our audience.\n    • We can focus on improving the persuasiveness and clarity of our\n      research, as discussed in the previous section.\n    • We can pursue partnerships with other donor/consumer resources.\n    • We can pursue partnerships with donor-advised funds and wealth\n      advisors, which might connect us to wealthy individuals seeking help\n      with their giving decisions.\n    • We can pursue partnerships with people and organizations that focus on\n      fundraising for particular causes, rather than particular\n      organizations. GiveWell’s research could help such organizations\n      fundraise for outstanding organizations within their causes (and\n      outsource responsibility for finding such organizations and justifying\n      their choices).\n    • We can pursue partnerships with corporate giving programs.\n    • We can advertise directly.\n    • We can make concerted efforts at “earned media,” i.e., focus our\n      research on issues that are likely to interest the media (which are\n      frequently the opposite of the issues we find most interesting and\n      important) and engage in concerted public relations efforts around\n      these issues.\n\nIs GiveWell a healthy organization with an active Board, staff in\nappropriate roles, appropriate policies and procedures, etc.?\n\nProgress since 11/08\nAs of 11/08, we were operating without an official Executive Director,\nreflecting the fact that we felt current staff did not have adequate\nresources in place for professional development and supervision (see\nour 9/08 meeting).\nOur Board of Directors consisted of only five people: Bob Elliott (then the\nChair, but unable due to his schedule to remain engaged in the project,\nwhich ultimately led him to resign his position in July 2009); Greg Jensen\n(then the Treasurer), Holden Karnofsky (Secretary), Lindy Miller and Tim\nOgden.\nSince then,\n    • We have substantially added to and changed the composition of the\n      Board (see our current Board members and positions). The Board now has\n      seven members, each of whom is highly accessible and engaged with the\n      project.\n    • We have replaced biweekly email reports with a monthly conference\n      call, substantially increasing engagement from the Board. Turnout at\n      conference calls has been high.\n    • We have substantially increased the ongoing professional development\n      and supervision of staff, leading the Board to confer the co-Executive\n      Director role on the two co-Founders. (See our 7/09 meeting.)\n    • We have adopted key policies.\nWhere we stand\nUnlike a year ago, we feel that our Board of Directors and our policies are\nappropriate for this stage of our project. We voluntarily comply with\nall BBB Wise Giving Alliance standards.\nWhat we can do to improve\nWe are always open to acquiring more Board members and mentors with\nsubstantial experience and ability to contribute to our project.\n\nWhat is GiveWell’s overall impact, particularly in terms of donations\ninfluenced? Does it justify the expense of running GiveWell?\n\nProgress since 11/08\nAs discussed above, we have seen substantial improvement in our “donations\ninfluenced” figures. A couple of questions remain as to the ultimate\nvalue/impact of influencing donations:\n    • Where would the donors we’re influencing be giving, if not for\n      GiveWell?\n    • How does the impact-per-dollar of GiveWell’s recommended charities\n      compare to that of the charities our “customers” would otherwise be\n      giving to?\nWe have only hunches regarding the first question, and at some point should\ndo a formal survey of our donors (including factual questions about their\npast giving as well as hypotheticals about where they would give without\nour existence) to get more meaningful information.\nOn the second question, we have done our best to answer “What do you get\nfor your dollar?” for our top charities - however, answering this question\nmeaningfully for our non-recommended charities is much more difficult (non-\nrecommended charities are generally not recommended because so little\ninformation is available about what they’re accomplishing). We have argued\nthat differences in charities can be enormous.\nIt is also worth addressing our impact on general perceptions regarding,\nand public discussion of, giving.\n    • We have become members of the Alliance for Effective Social\n      Investing as well as the GuideStar Exchange Advisory Board; both\n      reflect the fact that other notable organizations in the nonprofit\n      sector take our message and/or research seriously.\n    • Since our joint press release criticizing the overuse of the “overhead\n      ratio” metric, discussions of giving in the media have laid noticeably\n      less stress on the “overhead ratio” as the primary metric of interest,\n      and more stress on alternative approaches. Many of these\n      discussions have directly included GiveWell.\n    • On one hand, we were one of the issuers of this press release and we\n      have been stressing its message for a long time. On the other hand,\n      there are many other parties behind this message and this shift, and\n      we feel that relatively little of the credit can fairly be attributed\n      to GiveWell.\nWhere we stand\nGiveWell is not having nearly the impact that we would need to see in order\nto consider it a success. We still consider our project an experiment at\nthis point.\nWhat we can do to improve\nThe key paths to increasing GiveWell’s impact (as we see them) are laid out\nin the earlier sections of this post. Working on any of our many possible\nareas for improvement could lead to increased impact - the challenge is\nprioritizing. We’ll discuss broad priorities in a future post.\n\nGiveWell’s plan: top-level priorities\n\nIn a previous post, we discussed the progress we’ve made, where we stand,\nand how we can improve in core areas. This post focuses on the latter, and\nlays out our top-level strategic choice for the next year.\nBroadly, we see the key aspects of GiveWell - the areas in which we can\nimprove - as\nResearch, i.e., creating and maintaining useful information for impact-\nfocused donors. This includes\n    • Research vetting: subjecting our existing research to strong, critical\n      scrutiny from people with substantial relevant experience and\n      credentials.\n    • Research on new causes such as U.S. equality of opportunity, disease\n      research funding, and environmental issues (particularly global\n      warming mitigation).\n    • Research maintenance and systemization: formalizing our process to the\n      point where it can be maintained with as little input as possible\n      needed from the co-Founders.\nPackaging, i.e., presenting our research in a way that is likely to be\npersuasive and impactful. This includes\n    • Consolidating/writing up/improving the case for our research’s\n      credibility.\n    • Improving our website so that it is clearer and easier to use.\n    • Finding new ways to express the output of our research in ways that\n      are more emotionally/intellectually compelling.\nMarketing, i.e., increasing the number of potential “customers” we reach.\nThis includes.\n    • Improving the persuasiveness and clarity of our research.\n    • Pursuing partnerships with other donor/consumer resources.\n    • Pursuing partnerships with donor-advised funds and wealth advisors,\n      which might connect us to wealthy individuals seeking help with their\n      giving decisions.\n    • Pursuing partnerships with people and organizations that focus on\n      fundraising for particular causes, rather than particular\n      organizations. GiveWell’s research could help such organizations\n      fundraise for outstanding organizations within their causes (and\n      outsource responsibility for finding such organizations and justifying\n      their choices).\n    • Pursuing partnerships with corporate giving programs.\n    • Advertising.\n    • Concerted efforts at “earned media,” i.e., focusing our research on\n      issues that are likely to interest the media (which are frequently the\n      opposite of the issues we find most interesting and important) and\n      engaging in concerted public relations efforts around these issues.\n\nResearch vs. packaging/marketing\n\nOne of the core debates that comes up repeatedly among GiveWell\nstakeholders is whether we should focus on research vs. packaging\nmarketing.\nIn brief, the “focus on packaging/marketing” view is that:\n    • Our research is already more useful, for impact-focused donors, than\n      other available resources.\n    • Our reach, and impact, leave much to be desired.\n    • Therefore, we should focus on reaching more people. Doing so will lead\n      to quicker learning about the odds of GiveWell’s ultimately\n      succeeding, as well as quicker learning about what our potential\n      “customers” want from our research.\nThe “focus on research” view is that:\n    • We have substantial room for improvement in the credibility of our\n      research (who endorses it), the breadth of our research (how many\n      causes we’ve covered), and the robustness of our research (how\n      dependent our process is on the co-Founders).\n    • Improving these areas could be very important to later\n      packaging/marketing efforts. (Having knowledge of more causes could\n      substantially affect our strategy for “packaging” our research in ways\n      that people are likely to find interesting. Both the number of causes\n      and the overall credibility could be important to many of the\n      potential partners mentioned under our marketing options.)\n    • Many of the most promising marketing strategies can be expected to\n      benefit from the simple passage of time. We are interested in\n      partnering with organizations that take a long time to make decisions\n      and prefer that their partners have significant track records / be\n      relatively established.\n    • While our research, as well as the passage of time, could\n      substantially affect the way we package/market, the results of\n      packaging/marketing (and the passage of time) are unlikely to have\n      much effect on how we do our research. It therefore makes sense to\n      work more on research before focusing on packaging/marketing.\n    • We believe that we are only ~2 years away from having broad, robust,\n      credible research that could then be maintained at a relatively low\n      cost (both in terms of funds and human resources). Therefore, we think\n      it is practical and desirable to reach this point before focusing on\n      packaging/marketing.\n    • Research is our core competency. The content we created for impact-\n      focused donors is what makes us unique and it’s what we feel we do\n      better than any other organization. By contrast, we don’t consider\n      ourselves particularly good at packaging or marketing. By focusing on\n      research and making all of our output public and free, we enable\n      others (who may be much better at packaging/marketing) to use and\n      adapt it. (Peter Singer is an example of someone who has marketed our\n      research better than we could.)\nWe have had many internal discussions on these issues. At this point, all\nmembers of GiveWell’s Board and staff feel that the “focus on research”\nview is stronger.\nTherefore, we intend to focus on research over the next year, while\nallocating some time to the “lowest-hanging fruit” within\npackaging/marketing.\nA future post will discuss the specifics of how we’re prioritizing the\ndifferent aspects of “research.”\n\nGiveWell’s plan: specifics of research\n\nIn a previous post, we laid out our reasons for focusing on the broad\ncategory of “research” over the next year. This includes\n    • Research vetting: subjecting our existing research to strong, critical\n      scrutiny from people with substantial relevant experience and\n      credentials.\n    • Research on new causes such as U.S. equality of opportunity, disease\n      research funding, and environmental issues (particularly global\n      warming mitigation).\n    • Research maintenance and systemization: formalizing our process to the\n      point where it can be maintained with as little input as possible\n      needed from the co-Founders.\nAfter considering the time and resources available to us, we’ve concluded\nthe following:\n    • Research vetting will likely involve substantial “down time” (i.e.,\n      waiting for responses from the people we’re hoping to get vetting\n      from). Therefore, it will be a major priority of ours but will not\n      account for a huge amount of our time.\n    • Re: research maintenance and systemization. Over the next year, we\n      will be pursuing one temporary expansion in capacity via a 5-month\n      contractor (a person who has done substantial volunteer work for us in\n      the past, and whom we feel can add greatly to our research). During\n      that time, there will be four people putting substantial time into\n      research: the two co-Founders, our one Research Analyst, and the\n      contractor. It would not make sense to plan more hires at this point,\n      given the relatively small amount of well-defined work we have\n      available and the uncertain time costs of working with both our\n      Research Analyst and our contractor. (More reasoning at our previous\n      post, under the heading of “Is GiveWell’s research process ‘robust’?”)\n    • We will be putting significant time - essentially, the time we have\n      left over after dealing with research vetting, research maintenance\n      and systemization, and “low-hanging fruit” in the areas of packaging\n      and marketing - into research on new causes.\nThe top contenders for new causes are as follows, listed in the order in\nwhich we are currently prioritizing them:\n    • More sub-causes within international aid - including disaster\n      relief/recovery, charities aiming to help orphans and vulnerable\n      children, and more attempts to find a strong microfinance option.\n      Because we find international aid to be a strong area for a donor, and\n      because we have a strong sense of the major issues within it, this\n      cause is a high priority. We expect much of the work in this area to\n      be done by non-co-Founders (i.e., our Research Analyst and/or\n      contractor).\n    • U.S. equality of opportunity (early childhood care; education;\n      employment assistance). We have already done substantial work in this\n      area and have a concrete idea of how to create a high-quality report.\n      We expect to be able to outsource much of the work on this report to\n      non-co-Founders.. Therefore, although we don’t consider this the most\n      worthwhile cause, the “return on investment” for us is very high in\n      terms of what we can produce with a limited amount of work from the co-\n      Founders.\n    • Disease research funding. Our intuitions suggest that this is a very\n      promising area for a donor, but we have not done any work on it to\n      date, and as a result our research on it will be somewhat like our\n      research on international aid was at first: open-ended, slow, and\n      heavily dependent on co-Founders, with the rate and the nature of\n      progress difficult to predict. We hope eventually to understand enough\n      about this area that we can apply a consistent methodology to disease\n      research charities, as we do with our current international aid\n      report.\n    • Environmental issues, particularly global warming mitigation. As with\n      disease research, we have little background and expect a slow, open-\n      ended process at first.\nWe have assembled a work plan with time estimates. Over the next year, we\nexpect to complete research on the first two causes listed and to make some\nprogress (though how much is difficult to predict) on disease research\nfunding.\n\n"

|0     |\n\nBased on our surveys of donors, we conservatively estimate that Peter\nSinger directly accounted (through his book, the book’s website, or a\nspeech or article mentioning GiveWell) for approximately 50% of donations\nfor which we don’t know the source.  In 2009, we estimate that Mr. Singer\naccounted for $128,887.\n\nIt is also likely that Mr. Singer had a larger impact than this as we only\nattempt to estimate direct gifts and not indirect gifts, i.e., those donors\nthat found us through a source that found us in Peter Singer’s book.  For\nexample, a Slate (http://slate.com/id/2238732/) article that referred a\nsignificant number of visitors to the site may have mentioned GiveWell\nbecause of Mr. Singer’s book.\n\n\nPerformance in 2009 relative to 2007-08\n\n\nThe following chart shows cumulative, annual donations through the website,\ncomparing 2007-2009.  [pic]\n[pic]\n\n\n\nWe've attempted to strip out donors we have had personal contact with (we\naren't able to see the source of all donations, so some could be included,\nalthough we were able to see the source of - and thus strip out - many\ndonations in 2009 than previously).\n\nWhile the aggregate money moved figure (which includes all money donated to\ncharities due to GiveWell’s recommendation) is ultimately the more\nmeaningful measure of GiveWell’s impact, we believe that donations by\nwebsite visitors whom GiveWell staff don’t know personally is a more\nmeaningful measure of GiveWell’s progress as these donations represent (a)\nuse of the GiveWell tool as we ultimately envision it (i.e., retail donors\ncoming to the site and using it to give) and (b) are less susceptible to\nlarge, one-off circumstances that lead to large variations in the aggregate\nmoney moved figure (e.g., a $250,000 grant from an institutional funder).\n\n\nA note on unrestricted donations\n\n\nThe above analysis does not include unrestricted donations to GiveWell\n(except to the extent that we granted unrestricted funds at our 7/09 Board\nmeeting, adding $14,229.90 to our total \"money moved\" figure).\n\nWe have also seen increases in unrestricted donations from non-personal\nconnections over time.  The following charts present figures on donations\ndirect to GiveWell that were:\n    • Unrestricted.\n    • Under $5,000 in size (to prevent a small number of donors with\n      idiosyncratic giving histories from skewing the picture).\n    • Made by individuals whom we had no connection to prior to starting\n      GiveWell.  All donations by people who know us personally from a non-\n      GiveWell context, donations by people who were referred (one degree\n      away) by those people, corporate matches on such donations, and\n      donations from our former employer are excluded.\n    • Made after March 2008, when we implemented the option for people to\n      give unrestricted donations through our website.  (Prior to this, all\n      donations from people we had no personal connection to were marked as\n      restricted to grants.)\n\n   Small unrestricted donations from donors we had no prior connection to:\n                       monthly and cumulative dollars\n                                    [pic]\n\n\n   Small unrestricted donations from donors we had no prior connection to:\n                     monthly and cumulative # donations\n\n[pic]\n\nWeb analytics\n\n\n\nWeb visitors and engagement\n\n\nThe chart below shows web visitors (monthly) and visitors who signed up for\nemail updates since GiveWell started. Note:\n\n   1. On 12/20/2007, we received significant media coverage, resulting in\n      over 38,000 visitors coming to the site in the following week. The\n      left-axis on the chart below is set to 30,000 to remove the distortion\n      stemming solely from that day of media coverage.\n   2. Due to an error made by Holden or Elie during a website revision in\n      May 2008, we lost web tracking from May – December 22, 2008. Monthly\n      visitors are shown as zero for that period.\n\n\n[pic]\n\nNotes:\n\n   1. The rise in email sign-ups near the end of 2008 coincides with\n      Holden’s appearance on NPR.\n   2. The rise in email sign-ups at the beginning of 2009 coincides with the\n      release of Peter Singer’s book, The Life You Can Save, which\n      prominently features GiveWell.\n   3. The rise in email sign-ups at the end of 2009 coincides with (a)\n      significantly increased web traffic and (b) a website redesign which\n      places the sign-up button more prominently on the website.\n   4. Our tracking for the dates of sign-ups is not perfect and in some\n      cases we had to manually find sign-up dates by manually searching our\n      email for sign-up notifications. Because of this factor, we do not\n      list the exact date for all sign-ups, though the chart above is a\n      reasonable approximation.\n\n\nImprovements in website\n\n\nOne of the main focuses of late-2009 was improving our website to make it\neasier to use and more engaging.\n\nBecause a user’s engagement with the site will depend heavily on what\nreferred him/her to GiveWell, we compare data from visitors who came from\nAdWords (who all came from a Google search for a relevant keyword and\nlanded on our homepage).\n\nThe table below compares website engagement and use for comparable periods\nof 2008 and 2009 (December 26-31 of each year). We did not run AdWords\nbefore December 26, 2008, so we cannot compare performance.  We also show\nperformance from 2007 for context.\n\nEngagement stats show significant improvements in 2009 relative to 2008 and\n2007.\n\n|Website engagement/use: AdWords visitors                |\n|                          |       |          |          |\n|                          |2009   |2008      |2007      |\n|                          |       |          |          |\n|Engagement                |       |          |          |\n|Visits                    |1,067  |2,589     |1,099     |\n|Pages/Visit               |5.61   |4.00      |2.74      |\n|Avg.

The charts below distinguish between the two showing visits to the\nblog and the site separately.\n\nThe portion of visitors starting at the blog has continued to account for\napproximately 25% of visits as overall site traffic has grown.\n\n[pic]\n\n[pic]\n\nNote: these charts count visits not visitors, so it may overstate the\ncontribution of the blog as we would guess that blog readers are more\nlikely to repeatedly visit. (It may also understate the role of the blog as\n(a) many blog readers may follow the site through RSS readers (which don’t\nregister as site visits unless they click to the come to the site) and (b)\nthis group may comprise many of the most passionate GiveWell followers who\ndon’t frequently visit the main site.)\n\nThe chart below shows web visitors by source, showing that the increase in\nsite visits during the last quarter of 2004 came from multiple sources\n(i.e., we had more referral links, our Google search rankings improved, and\nmore visitors came directly). The rise was not due to just one source and\nwas not (largely) due to paid search traffic through Google AdWords (as it\nwas in December 2008).\n\n[pic]\n\n\nThis table shows the number of recipients of GiveWell updates that we send\nevery 1-2 months: (Note: numbers fall largely due to emails that are no\nlonger active)\n\n|Email update list size|\n|             |        |\n|10/5/08      |1,357   |\n|12/18/08     |1,525   |\n|3/5/09       |1,745   |\n|6/1/09       |1,838   |\n|7/16/09      |1,781   |\n|10/23/09     |1,919   |\n|12/1/09      |1,871   |\n|12/28/09     |2,082   |\n\n\nGiveWell search engine presence\n\n\nThe most direct measure of our success at improving GiveWell visibility in\nsearch rankings is visits to GiveWell from organic (i.e., non-paid) search.\n\nThe following chart shows the number of visits to the GiveWell site from\nsearches, excluding (a) paid-search (i.e., Google AdWords) and (b) searches\nthat are already looking for GiveWell (i.e., searches containing givewell,\ngive well, holden karnofsky, clear fund, etc.)\n\nThe chart demonstrates that GiveWell’s visibility in search rankings has\nrisen significantly in 2009, likely due to both (a) improved search engine\noptimization on the website and (b) improved page-rank due increased links\nto GiveWell from other sites.\n\n[pic]\n\nNote that the rise begins on approximately 10/11/09 (when monthly search\nvisitors doubles from approximately 1,500/month to 3,000/month). This\ncoincides with Natalie Stone’s focused work to improve GiveWell’s search\nrankings by creating search-engine-friendly links on the givewell site\n(e.g., http://www.givewell.net/international/economic-\nempowerment/microfinance vs http://www.givewell.net/node/537). Natalie\ncompleted this work on 10/8-10/9/09.\n\nOther factors that likely also contributed to the rise were:\n\n   1. Creating new pages with titles that had keywords we wanted to appear\n      for in Google (e.g., “Microfinance charity”)\n   2. Increased searching for charity-related words as giving season\n      approached\n   3. Improved page-rank in Google due to increased external links to\n      GiveWell\n\nWe can test #2 by looking at the performance of top keywords that led to\nthe recent rise. The table below compares the top keywords for the periods\nof 1/1/09-10/11/09 vs 10/12/09-12/31/09.\n\nThe improved search results appear to come largely from:\n\n   1. Improved rankings for searches for charities GiveWell has reviewed.\n      Examples are: population services international, smile train review,\n      smile train reviews, alliance for smiles, smile train, gfatm,\n      worldwide fistula fund. Note that search traffic fell for healthstore\n      foundation and something external to GiveWell likely occurred in the\n      “middle” period which led to increased search for highbridge community\n      life center.\n   2. Improved rankings for terms related to GiveWell’s work evaluating\n      charities. Examples are: top charities, top rated charities, water\n      charities, international charities, charities rated. We would guess\n      that the large improvement in search visibility for these keywords\n      (not only during “giving season”) reflects a significant improvement\n      in GiveWell’s visibility for individuals looking for the type of\n      research we offer. These terms are bolded in the table below.\n\n|Unique               |Overall| |Beginni|Middle |End    |Oct 12  | |Oct     |\n|                     |       | |ng     |       |       |to      | |12-Dec  |\n|                     |       | |       |       |       |        | |31      |\n|Keywords             |rank   | |traffic|traffic|Traffic|Dec 31  | |minus   |\n|                     |       | |Per    |per    |per    |traffic | |Jan     |\n|                     |       | |month  |month  |month  |        | |1-Oct 11|\n|                     |       | |       |       |       |per     | |traffic |\n|                     |       | |       |       |       |month   | |        |\n|                     |       | |       |       |       |        | |per     |\n|                     |       | |       |       |       |        | |month   |\n|                     |       | |       |       |       |        | |        |\n|Population services  |1      | |31     |55     |41     |65      | |34      |\n|international        |       | |       |       |       |        | |        |\n|highbridge community |2      | |5      |50     |6      |35      | |30      |\n|life center          |       | |       |       |       |        | |        |\n|top charities        |3      | |7      |17     |32     |35      | |28      |\n|smile train review   |4      | |4      |19     |45     |46      | |42      |\n|healthstore          |5      | |10     |0      |5      |4       | |-6      |\n|foundation           |       | |       |       |       |        | |        |\n|top rated charities  |6      | |3      |15     |42     |41      | |38      |\n|water charities      |7      | |1      |32     |29     |42      | |41      |\n|smile train rating   |7      | |4      |23     |15     |26      | |21      |\n|what is daly         |9      | |6      |9      |15     |17      | |11      |\n|toby ord\"\"           |10     | |0      |23     |34     |40      | |40      |\n|international        |10     | |3      |16     |19     |25      | |22      |\n|charities            |       | |       |       |       |        | |        |\n|alliance for smiles  |12     | |5      |8      |6      |9       | |4       |\n|smile train reviews  |13     | |2      |16     |25     |29      | |27      |\n|life expectancy sub  |14     | |5      |7      |5      |8       | |3       |\n|saharan africa       |       | |       |       |       |        | |        |\n|dots program         |15     | |4      |7      |12     |13      | |9       |\n|smile train          |16     | |2      |11     |24     |25      | |24      |\n|charities rated      |17     | |2      |11     |16     |20      | |18      |\n|Gfatm                |18     | |2      |13     |12     |17      | |15      |\n|worldwide fistula    |19     | |0      |11     |28     |28      | |28      |\n|fund                 |       | |       |       |       |        | |        |\n|life expectancy in   |20     | |3      |7      |4      |7       | |4       |\n|sub saharan africa   |       | |       |       |       |        | |        |\n\nNote:\n\n    • Overall rank is the keywords rank among that sent traffic to GiveWell\n      in 2009\n    • The “beginning” period is 1/1/09-10/11/09; “middle” is 10/12/09-\n      11/30/09; and, “end” is 12/1/09-12/31/09.\n    • The data in this table is a function of both (a) GiveWell’s presence\n      in search results and (b) the frequency with which a given term is\n      searched for\n    • Because there are so many different keywords, although these are the\n      20 most frequently visited words, they account for less than 6.6% of\n      total search visitors. The top 50 account for approximately 10% and\n      the top 500 for approximately 30% of search traffic.  In 2009,\n      visitors came to the GiveWell site using over 20,000 keywords.\n\nWe also show the change in GiveWell’s Google search rankings for 50\nimportant keywords. We identified and started tracking these keywords in\nmid-October 2009. We show changes as of 1/14/2010 (the date on which we\ncollected data).\n\nIt is unclear from this data whether our rankings improved or not on these\nkeywords.\n\nOur initial ranking therefore may be somewhat influenced by work we had\nalready completed aimed at improving our search engine presence.\n\n|Change in Google ranking by search volume                 |\n|                  |      |      |

We review our progress in the context of our organizational\nvision and mission as well as the priorities we laid out in our November\n2008 work plan, the last one approved by the board.[1]\n\nVision:\n\nA world in which charities are rewarded for effectiveness in improving\nlives.\n\nMission:\n\nTo find outstanding charities and publish the full details of our analysis\nto help donors decide where to give.\n\nThis section reviews our progress since our last work plan, approved in\nNovember 2008.[2]  It addresses the following priorities, which\nconceptually correspond to the priorities listed in the November 2008 work\nplan:\n\n   1. Improving organizational capacity through hiring.  We had several\n      unsuccessful hires, but are now working with one promising new hire\n      (who has been with us since July 2009).\n   2. In-depth research on international aid.  We completed our 2008-2009\n      report and recommendations for international aid.  The report does not\n      contain exactly the content we initially planned for it, but does\n      contain what we feel are substantially improved recommendations and\n      research and was delivered by the deadline we gave people who had made\n      GiveWell Pledges.\n   3. Outreach/connecting with customers.  We were featured in The Life You\n      Can Save by Peter Singer.  We have seen improvement in website traffic\n      and engagement, although we do not have as much data as we should due\n      to an error in 2008.\n   4. Pursuing important relationships.  We have joined the Alliance for\n      Effective Social Investing.  We have made some, but in our view\n      insufficient, progress in making research-related connections (i.e.,\n      to international aid scholars who can provide critical feedback on our\n      work).\n\n                        GiveWell’s vision and mission\n\nGiveWell’s ultimate vision is of a world in which:\n\n    • Individual donors can easily find actionable information about what\n      charities do and whether it works.\n    • A large amount of money from these donors flows systematically to the\n      charities with the most proven, cost-effective, scalable ways of\n      helping people.\n    • This dynamic – charities competing for funding based on demonstrated\n      impact – leads to an ongoing public dialogue about how to help people,\n      and to constant improvement in the way charitable resources are\n      allocated.\n\nWe accomplish this by:\n\n    • Carrying out intensive, full-time research  in order to find\n      outstanding charities and make informed recommendations.\n    • Publicly publishing our recommendations, reasoning and sources to the\n      web.\n    • Building publicity and a reputation for quality in order to get donors\n      to use these recommendations.\n    • Financing our grants, salaries, and operating expenses with direct\n      donations from those most passionate about our work.\n             1. Improving organizational capacity through hiring\n\nOur 11/08 business plan stated:\n\n      We aim to hire one Research Assistant by Jan. 1, [2009].  In hiring,\n      we will start with our existing base of volunteers, and seek the\n      following qualities:\n\n\n         • Strong analytical abilities.\n         • Strong interest in GiveWell.\n         • A good work ethic.\n\nPart of the rationale for seeking to make a hire was a particular vision  of\nour  research  process,  which  we  revised  following  the  12/15/08  Board\nmeeting.[3]  As a result, we had a slight change of course, and although  we\nhad identified two strong candidates prior to 1/1/09, we opted to delay  our\nhiring decision.  We then  had  a  short  series  of  part-time  hires  that\nultimately did not work out.\n\nHire 1: started in mid-January 2009.  Performed well, but left for  location\nand stability reasons (having received another job offer) in February 2009.\n\nHire 2: started in late January 2009.  Released by GiveWell due to  lack  of\nfit in February 2009.\n\nHire 3: started in early February 2009.  Released by GiveWell  due  to  lack\nof fit in March 2009.\n\nOverall, this period of hiring was ultimately unsuccessful,  and  we  put  a\nhold on our active recruiting.\n\nWe hired Melissa Krauss in May 2009, when  we  were  near  the  end  of  our\nresearch process and had a clearer idea of what we were  looking  for.   She\nstarted on a part-time basis and shifted to full-time  in  June  2009.   She\nleft for a job in consulting in December 2009.\n\nWe hired Natalie Stone in July 2009.  She is  still  employed  full-time  by\nGiveWell as of this writing (1/22/2010).\n\nBoth hires consistently did productive and useful work, and Ms. Stone  shows\nthe potential ability and willingness to continue contributing  to  GiveWell\nfor at  least  the  next  year.   Currently,  Ms.  Stone  is  in  charge  of\nmaintaining the international aid report (particularly  investigating  newly\nsubmitted and other pending charities).  Ms. Krauss focused on  the  process\n(now completed) for our $250,000 grant in economic empowerment.\n\nCompared to the earlier-in-the-year hires, we have  substantially  increased\nboth the clarity of duties and the amount of  supervision  and  auditing  we\nprovide.\n\n    • Our international aid report, now completed, provides a clear template\n      for evaluating  charities  (see  http://www.givewell.net/node/430)  as\n      well as several clear examples of the  template  applied.   New  hires\n      have “taken the lead” on investigating and questioning charities.\n    • We have performed regular reviews of new hires’ work,  including  both\n      overviews of their output and quality and audits of their attention to\n      detail  (in  which  we  replicate  selected  portions  of  their  work\n      ourselves).\n\n                  2. In-depth research on international aid\n\nOur 11/08 business plan stated:\n\n      We aim to publish an in-depth research report on developing-world aid\n      by June 1, 2009.  The report will include:\n\n\n         • Activities listings and basic ratings for each of the\n           approximately 800 US-registered international-aid charities with\n           annual budgets in excess of $1 million.\n         • At least 10 recommended charities in all, and at least one\n           recommended charity within each of the following areas:\n               o Direct health interventions\n               o Economic empowerment programs (microfinance, agricultural\n                 training, irrigation, etc.)\n               o Primary and secondary education (scholarships, school\n                 building)\n         • Literature reviews on several general questions about\n           international aid (see http://blog.givewell.net/?p=303)\n         • Detailed notes on two focus regions\n\n    •  We  released  our  report  on  7/1/09.   (Slightly  later  emails  to\n      stakeholders were less committed to  the  6/1/09  deadline,  targeting\n      “mid-2009” or 7/1/09.  In other words, the deadline was revised  early\n      – by 1/1/09 – and adhered to afterward.)\n    • We abandoned the idea  of  “activities  listings”  for  all  charities\n      following  the  12/15/08  Board   meeting.[4]    Upon   refining   our\n      eligibility criteria, we reduced the number of  charities  considered,\n      but examined all (320) eligible charities and provided a basic take on\n      each.  See http://www.givewell.net/international/technical/criteria\n    •  We  recommended  6.   See  http://www.givewell.net/international/top-\n      charities\n    • We completed literature reviews on several major issues.\n         o See http://www.givewell.net/archive/2009/causes\n         o We have posted several  less  central  issue  overviews  to  The\n           GiveWell                       Blog.                         See\n           http://www.givewell.net/international/miscellaneous-issues\n    • We did not complete detailed notes on two focus regions.\n\nOur view of which issues were most important to cover shifted as  we  gained\nfamiliarity with the  literature,  and  we  did  not  find  as  many  strong\ncharities as we had hoped, but we feel  that  we  accomplished  the  broader\ngoal of publishing a highly  thorough  report  on  international  aid,  with\nactionable recommendations.\n\n                    3. Outreach/connecting with customers\n\nOur 11/08 business plan stated:\n\n      At this point we do not have a single strategy for pursuing customers\n      that we believe is cost-effective and reliable.  Instead, we have many\n      possible strategies that we are interested in (or in the process of)\n      experimenting with … At this point we do not have a good sense of the\n      expected return on time for any of the following strategies, and as\n      such do not want to commit to a specific deliverable.  Instead, we\n      plan to allocate 10 hours per week to experimenting with these\n      strategies (in the rough order of priority listed) and estimate the\n      return on different strategies in terms of the following metrics …\n\nThe specific strategies listed in the business  plan  yielded  few  results,\nbut we made some preliminary progress with outreach through  two  paths  not\nmentioned in that document.  These strategies and their  results  are  given\nin chronological order (i.e., the first section  discusses  improvements  to\nthe website in 2008 but not in 2009).\n\nWebsite improvements - December 2008\n\nIn December 2008, we reorganized our  website  with  the  aim  of  improving\n“conversions”  for  the  holiday  season.   We  created  “highlight”   pages\nsummarizing  the  most  salient  points  of  our  research,  as  well  as  a\nconsolidated list of top charities, and linked both  from  our  front  page.\nWe also partly revised our  navigation  system  and  conducted  formal  user\ntesting using usertesting.com.\n\nUnfortunately, we are missing traffic data for July-December  2008,  but  we\ndo have donation data.  There were 127 donations made  through  our  \"Donate\nusing Network for Good\" links, totaling  $28,605,  in  December  2008.   For\ncomparison, December 2007 saw 151 donations for $31,704 – roughly  the  same\namount of giving, despite the fact that  we  had  substantially  more  media\ncoverage in 2007 than in 2008 and that the U.S.  economy  was  substantially\nstronger in 2007 than in 2008.\n\nAppearance in The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer\n\nIn March 2009, The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer  was  published.   This\nbook focused on arguing the case for more total giving to international  aid\norganizations, but also included a  discussion  of  where  one  should  give\n(Chapter 6), and put GiveWell at the center of  this  discussion.   GiveWell\nwas    also    featured    prominently     on     the     book’s     website\n(http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com) and mentioned in some of  the  mainstream\nmedia coverage of the book, including William Easterly’s review in the  Wall\nStreet Journal.[5]\n\nWe saw our monthly traffic roughly double in the month following the\nrelease of the book.  The bump in traffic subsided, but there appears to\nhave been a substantial and sustained rise in donations and other\n“conversion metrics” (see Section 2) through the website.\n\nWebsite improvements and joint press release - September-December 2009\n\nFrom September through December 2009, we focused on improving our odds of\nattracting customers.\n         • Elie focused on improving the main GiveWell.net website,\n           including a visual redesign, revised organization, a new landing\n           page, and creation of \"summary\" pages to make our research\n           findings more accessible.\n         • Holden focused on using the blog to present (a subset of) our\n           research such that particular general-interest points can be\n           followed without having to read through a lot of other\n           context.[6]\n         • Board member Tim Ogden coordinated a joint press release with\n           Philanthropedia, Great Nonprofits, GuideStar, Charity Navigator\n           and the Hewlett Foundation criticizing the prevailing practice\n           of evaluating charities by their \"overhead expense ratio,\"[7] a\n           message that has been core to GiveWell since before it was a\n           full-time project.[8]\n\nAs our January 2010 Metrics Report shows, media mentions, website traffic,\nengagement, and donations dwarfed those of December 2009 compared to\nDecember 2008.  We conjecture that the improvement was due to some\ncombination of the above three efforts, plus Peter Singer's book and the\nsimple value of having been visible for another year.\n\nSummary\n\nWe did not pursue the original strategies for outreach we had laid out.  We\nfocused more on improving the appeal of our content than on pushing for\n\"more eyeballs.\"  However, we did put substantial effort into attracting\nmore customers and saw substantial progress.\n\n                     4. Pursuing important relationships\n\nOur 11/08 business plan stated:\n\n      We seek to build relationships with people such as:\n\n\n         • Successful supporters to serve as mentors and members of the\n           Board of Directors\n         • Partners who can help us reach potential users of our research\n         • Donors who can increase our money moved and continue to build\n           our network.\n         • High-credibility supporters for our Advisory Board\n\n\n      We currently spend a total of about 15 hours per week on\n      correspondence (via email) with current and potential contacts.  We\n      believe that we can maintain this allocation and reach the following\n      deliverables:\n\n\n         • A total of three experienced entrepreneurs who serve as mentors\n           to us on a regular basis.  (We currently have one.)\n         • A total of five highly credible and/or visible figures who serve\n           on our Advisory Board and endorse our research.  (We currently\n           have two.)\n         • A total of 15 donors who (a) know us only from GiveWell; (b)\n           have pledged or donated at least $1,000; (c) are publicly on\n           record with these pledges/donations, possibly through video\n           testimonials. (We currently have 17 contacts who meet the first\n           two conditions.)\n\n    • For much of 2009, we had two  \"mentors\"  that  we  talked  with  on  a\n      regular basis.  We also changed the composition and role of our  Board\n      of  Directors  so  that  it  provides  substantially  more  oversight,\n      including  a  weekly  conversation  with  Board   Vice-President   and\n      management consultant Lindy Miller Crane.  Our  Board  has  officially\n      determined that we have established an appropriate level of  oversight\n      and mentoring, and has restored the Executive Director title to  staff\n      (specifically, Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld now serve  as  co-\n      Executive Directors).[9]\n    • We have dropped the idea of an official Advisory Board, preferring  to\n      pursue arms-length public feedback on our work and retain  flexibility\n      about whom we speak to and when.  We have spoken  with  many  relevant\n      experts in the course of our research,[10] but have not  yet  had  the\n      chance to pursue public feedback on our completed report.  This  is  a\n      priority over the next few months.\n    • We have de-prioritized the idea of individual donors’  going  publicly\n      on record with their donations.\n\nFinding partners who can help us reach potential users of our  research  has\nnot been a priority  over  the  last  12  months,  but  we  have  made  some\npreliminary progress.  We are now members  of  the  Alliance  for  Effective\nSocial  Investing,  which  includes  the  CEOs  of  major  donor   resources\n(GuideStar, Charity Navigator, BBB Wise Giving Alliance),[11]  and  we  have\nalso made some other preliminary progress that is not shared in  the  public\nversion of this report.\n\n-----------------------\n[1] http://www.givewell.net/about/progress#200811\n[2] http://www.givewell.net/about/progress#200811\n[3] See < http://givewell.net/board-meeting8>\n[4] See < http://givewell.net/board-meeting8>\n[5] See http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123621201818134757.html\n[6] Summary at http://blog.givewell.net/2010/01/04/roundup-of-recent-\nblogging/\n[7] http://blog.givewell.net/2009/12/01/the-worst-way-to-pick-a-charity/\n[8] See our blog series that ran from January through March of 2007:\nhttp://blog.givewell.net/category/thoughts-on-evaluating/down-with-the-\nstraw-ratio/\n[9] http://www.givewell.net/about/official-records/board-meeting-10\n[10] See\nhttp://www.givewell.net/international/technical/additional/conversations-\nwith-experts\n[11] http://www.alleffective.org/bios/HoldenKarnofsky.html\n\n"

We have had several\n      \"false starts\" on disaster relief and disease research funding.\n      Overall, we are falling slightly short of our earlier projections in\n      this area.\n    • Packaging/marketing/outreach: we have put substantial time into\n      speaking engagements, conferences, and talks with GuideStar and other\n      potential partners.\n    • Development of general charity evaluation frameworks\n\n                   Research maintenance and systemization\n\nGoal as of 2/2010: no specific goal outlined.\n\nProgress since 2/2010:\n    • Completed extensive internal review (checking each claim against\n      support given) of our 2010 research report.  This was a significant\n      time investment.\n    • Systemized process of this internal review; created assignments for\n      volunteers.  We have had two volunteers doing significant work along\n      these lines.\n    • Natalie Stone has taken responsibility for annual updates on our\n      recommended charities and for exploring new charities.  All\n      recommended charities and several potential recommended charities have\n      reviews in progress, but none have had their update completed yet.\n    • Natalie Stone and Simon Knutsson both have long-term potential.\n\nPlan and priority:\n\n    • Natalie Stone to finish annual updates of recommended charities by\n      11/1/2010.\n    • Natalie Stone to continue investigating potential recommended\n      charities, as a medium priority.\n    • Further internal review work to be conducted by volunteers.\n\n                      Research vetting and credibility\n\nGoal as of 2/2010: \"subject our existing research to strong, critical\nscrutiny from people with substantial relevant experience and credentials.\"\n We also sought to consolidate the case for our research's credibility\n(this was filed under marketing but I am now filing it here).\n\nProgress since 2/2010:\n    • We decided to conduct our extensive internal review before actively\n      pursuing critical scrutiny from people with substantial relevant\n      experience and credentials.\n    • However, we have had preliminary conversations with 4 such people, 3\n      of whom have agreed that they should be able to complete some vetting\n      when we are ready, and 1 of whom (the best-credentialed of the four)\n      said it was a possibility but depends on his schedule.\n    • At this point we have created a variety of \"vetting assignments,\"\n      ranging from narrow to broad evaluations of our work.\n         o We have sent one fairly broad assignment (evaluating our basic\n           criteria and heuristics) to Laura Freschi\n           (http://dri.fas.nyu.edu/object/laura_freschi.html), who has said\n           she should be able to complete it within a month.\n         o We have sent a narrower assignment (reviewing our work on\n           HIV/AIDS) to Matt Bonds\n           (http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/matthew-bonds/) and have\n           not yet heard back.\n         o For our broadest assignment (the \"Celebrity Jeopardy\"\n           assignment, choosing a charity to give to within a pre-specified\n           period of time) we are planning a dry run with a volunteer,\n           after which we will send it to an academic who has agreed to\n           complete it\n    • We have collected quotes on GiveWell from 6 relatively well-\n      credentialed people (2 of these quotes we simply pulled from existing\n      online works; the others were provided to us on request); we are\n      working/waiting on 4 more; and 1 person has declined our request on\n      the basis of not wanting to burn bridges with large NGOs.\n\nPlan and priority:\n\nAt this point the bottleneck is others, not us. We are moving\nincrementally; as we see how vetting assignments go, we will modify them\nand potentially invite more people to complete them.\n\nWe expect to have at least 2 reviews of substantial portions of our\nresearch, along with resolutions on everyone we've asked for quotes, well\nbefore giving season.\n\n\n                           Research on new causes\n\n\nGoal as of 2/2010: complete research on U.S. equality of opportunity and\nfurther sub-causes within international aid by 9/1/2010.  Work on disease\nresearch funding as well, with no specific goal in mind.\n\nProgress since 2/2010:\n    • Went through academic research on U.S. equality of opportunity\n      programs; identified and contacted promising charities running\n      promising programs; collected evidence for key points in this report.\n    • Several rounds of using heuristics to identify promising microfinance\n      organizations, contacting microfinance organizations and evaluating\n      them.\n    • Still in early stages with disaster relief and disease research.  We\n      have had many conversations with people in relevant fields, and\n      several \"false starts\" in terms of finding the appropriate criteria\n      and process.\n\nPlan and priority:\n    • We are on track to publish U.S. equality of opportunity research and\n      microfinance research by giving season.  (As of 2/2010, we had hoped\n      to publish by 9/1/2010; we think this is possible but optimistic at\n      this point.)\n    • We are unsure whether we will have anything to publish regarding\n      disaster relief and disease research.  We will not be researching\n      orphans and vulnerable children this year (it was on the agenda as of\n      2/2010).\n    • U.S. research is Simon Knutsson's top priority; microfinance research\n      is Natalie Stone's; the co-Founders are working on disease research\n      and disaster relief only as medium priorities.\n\n\n                        Packaging/marketing/outreach\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal as of 2/2010: focus only on \"low-hanging fruit\" in this area.\n\n\nProgress since 2/2010:\n    • At least one substantial blog post per week.\n    • Partnership with GuideStar via TakeAction portal\n    • Appearances at several conferences/meetings:\n         o Elie spoke at the HBS Social Enterprise Forum.\n         o Holden spoke at the Jewish Funders' Network conference.\n         o Both Holden and Elie attended the 3-day Markets for Good\n           meeting, hosted by GlobalGiving, in June 2010.\n         o Two more speaking engagements are planned in 2010.\n\nPlan and priority:\n\nWorking with potential partners is a high priority whenever it comes up.\nWe intend to continue producing at least one substantive blog post per\nweek.  Otherwise, this area is low priority.\n\n\n            Development of general charity evaluation frameworks\n\n\nThis section was not on our radar as of 2/2010, but due to our\nconversations with potential partners we have spent some time developing\ngeneral frameworks for evaluating charities.\n\nOne, which we are calling the \"General Charity Evaluation Framework,\" is a\ncompletely general set of 10 questions, to be applied to any charity.  This\nhas been developed in collaboration with Ken Berger of Charity Navigator\nand Tris Lumley of New Philanthropy Capital.  We are currently planning to\nrun it by a few more parties before publishing it publicly and advocating\nits adoption by groups including GuideStar, Charity Navigator and Jumo,\nwith the hope being that charities receive \"transparency scores\" for\nanswering the 10 questions (and once they've done so, GiveWell is in a\nbetter position to evaluate them).\n\nThe other, which we have called the \"Do-It-Yourself Project\" (DIY) for now,\nis a set of questions by cause, intended more for donors than for\ncharities/evaluators. We will shortly be publishing our first draft of DIY,\nand hope that Charity Navigator, GuideStar and Jumo will consider adapting\nit as an informational tool for donors; we may also use it on our own site\nfor visitors interested in causes we haven't covered.\n\n\n                                    Other\n\n\n    • Holden completed a 2-week trip to Africa, and all of GiveWell is\n      planning a 3-month trip to India, to deepen our understanding of\n      developing-world interventions.\n    • We have acquired the GiveWell trademark and givewell.org domain name\n    • We are in the final stages of our FY 2009 audit.\n\n"

Since  expenses  were  often\n      postponed and re-approved, it is usually not accurate to consider  the\n      \"Board-approved figure for the full year\" to be the sum of the  Board-\n      approved figures at different points in time. Instead,  the  following\n      techniques were used to impute the  \"implied\"  Board-approvd  FY  2009\n      expenses.\n         o MAX: the total expenses approved by the Board are imputed to  be\n           the maximum they approved in the category in question,  in  each\n           of their 3 budget approvals.  For expenses that were mostly  not\n           expected to be ongoing yearly expenses,  and  thus  were  either\n           met, postponed or canceled, this technique is used.\n         o ACTUAL: this method is used only for grants.   Grants  are  made\n           based on the supply of earmarked funds  plus  \"excess  reserves\"\n           (defined in internal procedures manual); it is understood by the\n           Board that the amount given in grants will always be  determined\n           in this way.  Therefore, while estimates are created in advance,\n           they should not be considered \"budgeted\" figures, and it is most\n           appropriate to consider the actual grant expenses  as  equal  to\n           \"approved\" grant expenses.\n         o TOTAL: this method is used for expenses that are expected to  be\n           spread out over the year; it is simply the total of  the  Board-\n           approved expenses at each of the three points.\n    • \"Grants\" includes the grants approved at the December meeting,  though\n      they were not disbursed until early 2010.\n    • The \"insurance\" figure is high because  (a)  we  don't  seem  to  have\n      budgeted appropriately for it; (b) we have switched to more expensive,\n      but better, insurance coverage;  (c)  we  are  now  counting  workers'\n      compensation  insurance   and   disability   benefits   insurance   as\n      \"insurance\" rather than \"payroll taxes.\"  The higher cost allocated to\n      insurance is accounted for in the projected budget going forward.\n\n  Past budget: 1/1/2010-5/31/2010 (excluding grants, which were included in\n                             2009 budget above)\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n    • \"Misc admin\" includes $2000 in legal fees associated with domain  name\n      transfer; $600 in still-due advertising expenses from 2009;  ~$500  in\n      unanticipated travel expenses; ~$350 for a required  software  upgrade\n      (required every few years).\n    • Salaries & benefits lower than anticipated primarily  because  one  of\n      our two contractors wasn't retained.\n    • Domain name expenses were discussed at previous meeting.\n                    Projected budget: 6/1/2010-5/31/2011\n                             (Excluding grants)\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n                             Available reserves\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n    • We have raised Natalie Stone's pay to a rate corresponding to  $45,000\n      per year (from $35,000).\n    • Projected revenue does not include any projected  restricted  revenue.\n      It does include a  projected  $50,000  in  support  from  the  Hewlett\n      Foundation.\n    • According to the above figures, we would run out  of  funds  in  March\n      2012 if the \"major anticipated  revenue\"  is  received  but  no  other\n      revenue is. Our \"excess reserves policy\" is not currently triggered.\n\n\n                               Proposed grants\n\n    • Our \"excess reserves policy\" is not currently triggered.\n    • $11,352.60 of current and anticipated reserves are  restricted  to  be\n      regranted to top charities at our discretion.  We  propose  that  this\n      sum  be  divided  between  our  current   two   top-rated   charities:\n      VillageReach and the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership.\n\n"

I have included notes with each.\n\n    • Director and Officers liability.  We are covered.\n    • General liability (\"protects the assets of a business when it is sued\n      for something it did (or didn't do) to cause an injury or property\n      damage\"[1]).  We do not believe we are at risk for liability for\n      physical injury/property damage.  Our only coverage in this area is\n      therefore Internet Liability insurance. However, since we recently\n      started working in a co-working space (rather than from our homes and\n      from fully public spaces), we will be doing some investigation to see\n      whether our risks in this area have increased.\n    • Business travel (can protect against lost property, reimburse for\n      canceled flights, cover health expenses while traveling, etc.[2]).  We\n      have no general coverage. We have purchased trip-specific insurance in\n      the past.\n    • Fire/theft.  We are not covered.  All important records, as well as\n      periodic (at least once per month) backups of all of our website\n      content, are maintained electronically on our personal computers and\n      backed up in real-time to a remote server via the Carbonite service.\n      Holden last tested this service in December by accidentally wrecking\n      his hard drive.  The service performed well.\n    • Employee dishonesty (theft/embezzlement[3]).  We are not covered.\n    • Hired and non-owned auto.  We are not covered.\n    • Professional Liability (\"protects professional practitioners such as\n      Architects, quantity surveyors, home inspectors, Lawyers, physicians,\n      and Accountants against potential negligence claims made by their\n      patients/clients.\")[4]  We are not covered.\n    • Employment practices.  We are covered (see above).\n    • Business interruption.  We are not covered.\n    • Hurricane/flood.  We are not covered.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------\n[1] http://smallbusiness.dnb.com/finance/insurance-liability-insurance/389-\n1.html accessed 2/27/2010\n[2] http://www.life123.com/career-money/career-development/business-\ntravel/do-you-need-business-travel-insurance.shtml accessed 2/27/2010\n[3] http://www.naplia.com/employeedishonesty/index.shtml\n[4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_liability_insurance accessed\n2/27/2010\n\n"

We  have  decided  for\nthe time being to split  networking  and  donor  cultivation  among  current\nstaff rather than hiring a professional fundraiser.\n\nAs of 12/31/2010,\n\n    •  We  held  $492,752.58  in  unrestricted  reserves   or   un-deposited\n      contributions.\n    • Projected 2011 expenses total $377,916.85;  projected  revenues  total\n      $307,483.65.\n    • Projected 2012 expenses total $445,701.64;  projected  revenues  total\n      $357,483.65.\n    • We seek (and expect) to raise a minimum of $70,000.00 more in 2011  to\n      match expenses and revenues. If we fail to raise at  least  $40,000.00\n      of this goal (net of losses in expected revenues), we will release one\n      staff member to ensure sustainability.\n    • If revenue were to  cease  at  this  moment,  and  we  maintained  our\n      existing plans for expenses, our reserves alone would last until April\n      2012.\n    • Our reserves policy is not  triggered  (starting  in  June  2011,  our\n      reserves will be insufficient for 12 months of projected expenses; our\n      reserves policy is triggered only when we expect to have 12 months  of\n      cash on hand for each of the next 12 months).\n\n\n                                   Details\n\n2011 and 2012 budgets\n\n    • One of our top priorities this year is finding  and  developing  staff\n      who can maintain GiveWell over the long  run.  We  therefore  wish  to\n      retain as many good Analysts as we can find and manage.\n    • We currently have 2 full-time Analysts (one junior  and  one  senior),\n      one part-time Analyst who hopes to join as a senior Analyst  in  June,\n      and one junior Analyst who will be joining over the summer.\n    • Our original Analyst salary of $35,000 was set  in  2007;  a  cost-of-\n      living adjustment would set it at $37,500.[1] We also feel the quality\n      of our incoming Analysts is higher than what we were seeking  when  we\n      originally set this rate. We intend  to  set  junior  Analyst  pay  at\n      $40,000 and senior analyst pay at $50,000.\n    • We seek to set Director pay at $75,000, pending Board approval.\n    • We tentatively plan on raising pay for all employees by $5,000 in mid-\n      2012, conditional on strong performance.\n\n\nCurrent assets\n\n\nBank accounts and short-term expected revenue as of 12/31/10:\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n\nProjected revenue\n\n\nBetween 2/1/10 and 1/31/11,\n    • We received $207,483.65 in  unrestricted  contributions  from  sources\n      whom we expect to renew their contributions.\n    • We received $24,365.66 in unrestricted contributions from sources  who\n      may renew their contributions (these are people we don't know anything\n      about except that they gave).\n    • We received $20,000.00 in unrestricted support from a  donor  who  has\n      changed careers and will not be renewing.\n    • We received $60,000.00 in funding from the Hewlett  Foundation,  which\n      we expect to renew its support in early 2012.\n    • We expect another $90,000 from specific new donors in 2011, $80,000 in\n      2012.\n\n\n                          Projected cash flow: 2011\n\n\n[pic]\n\n\n\n                          Projected cash flow: 2012\n\n\n[pic]\n\n-----------------------\n[1] ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/suppl/eci.echistrynaics.txt\n\n"

We believe\n      it’s appropriate to consider GiveWell’s “money moved” when comparing\n      our budget size to the size of other grantmakers and organizations\n      focused on improving the philanthropic sector.\n    • In December 2010, GiveWell.org had over 33,500 unique visitors; in\n      January 2011, GiveWell.org had over 20,000 unique visitors.\n\nComparable organizations\n\nWe have identified the three organizations below as the most comparable\norganizations to GiveWell for which data is available. None of these\norganizations is perfectly comparable to GiveWell in either size or focus.\n\nAmerican Institute of Philanthropy. According to its website, “The American\nInstitute of Philanthropy (AIP) is a nationally prominent charity watchdog\nservice whose purpose is to help donors make informed giving decisions.”\nThe AIP publishes “the triannual Charity Rating Guide included in the\nCharity Watchdog Report, informs donors about how over 500 national\ncharities spend your money and keeps donors up to date on current issues\nrelated to charitable giving.”\n\n    • According to its 2009 IRS Form 990, AIP had a budget of $452,623 in\n      2009.\n    • According to Compete.com, charitywatch.org (the AIP’s website) had\n      91,000 and 45,000 unique visitors in December 2010 and January 2011,\n      respectively. This is approximately 2-3x the traffic givewell.org\n      received over the same period.\n    • According to its 2009 IRS Form 990, AIP’s Executive Director earned\n      $143,115 (+5,157 to other compensation) in 2009.\n\nRoot Cause.  According to its website, “Root Cause is a research and\nconsulting firm dedicated to mobilizing the nonprofit, public, and business\nsectors to work together in a new social impact market.”  Like GiveWell,\nRoot Cause is a member of the Alliance for Effective Social Investing.\n\n    • According to its 2008 IRS Form 990, Root Cause had a budget of $2.9m\n      in 2009.\n    • According to Compete.com, rootcause.org had 555 and 4,000 unique\n      visitors in December 2010 and January 2011, respectively.\n    • According to its 2009 IRS Form 990, Root Cause’s Executive Director\n      earned $125,141 (+ 9,218 in other compensation) in 2009.\n\nPhilanthropedia. According to its website, Philanthropedia “rate[s]\nverified, financially responsible charities according to how much great\nwork they're doing.\n\n    • According to its 2009 IRS Form 990, Philanthropedia had a budget of\n      $103.829 in 2009.\n    • According to Compete.com, myphilanthropedia.org had 3,570 and 922\n      unique visitors in December 2010 and January 2011, respectively.\n    • According to its 2009 IRS Form 990, Philanthropedia's COO (its highest-\n      paid employee) earned $31,250 in 2009.\n\n\n-----------------------\n[1] http://www.nonprofitstaffing.com/getdoc/1694a3c7-201f-429d-b0a4-\n81ea3a016c61/PNP-Salary-Survey-2010---NY.aspx\n\n"

Although \nsome executives believe these challenges will continue into 2010, most feel \nthat, despite some continuing hardships, their organization’s future is brighter \nthan expected. \nOur NY survey respondents reported a belief in the continuation of a slow and \ngradual recovery and substantial opportunities for organizations that are able to adapt. \nNonprofit leaders understand that they need to be able to navigate through short \nterm challenges so that they can later take advantage of longer term opportunities. \nIt is important for an organization to position itself now for the next stage of the \nrecovering economy.  From our survey this year, it is evident that NY nonprofit \nmanagers are doing exactly that.  A significant number of you have continued your \ncommitment to programs and services and are beginning to hire staff that was laid \noff, filling vacancies, as well as adding new positions.   \nNY organizations, on the whole, maintained salaries at pre-2009 levels and, for \nsome specialties, increased compensation.  Fundraising salaries rose by about 10% and \nhigh level finance salaries increased by about 7%. \nManagers noted that it was difficult to find the talent they needed in the \nmarketplace so when they did, they paid a little more. Even when doing more with \nless is the rule rather than the exception, hiring and maintaining outstanding talent is \nstill the most critical issue for every organization. \nIn year 2009, NY organizations also reported the following: \n39% laid-off staff; 61% did not lay off any staff \n50% froze salaries; 50% offered slight pay increases where appropriate \n22% reduced benefits; 78% continued benefits as is  \n19% reduced programs; 81% continued to provide all programs & services \n24% hired staff to fill critical vacancies \nTemps now represent a large portion of overall employment.  It has become \nimpossible to work without a good reliable temp workforce to lean on. 3327 PNP SALARY SURVEY NY09:Layout 1  2/2/10  1:47 PM  Page 1\n\nASSOCIATIONS, EDUCATION & ARTS ORGANIZATIONS

priority. As organizations position \nthemselves to compete for resources, hiring and retaining the best staff may be the \ndifference between an organization’s success or failure. \nMyth:  No need to worry about staff retention – no one is going anywhere. \nReality: High performing staff, a limited resource, is always hard to find.  Competition for \ntop talent between similar organizations is fierce.  Retaining the best staff is an ongoing \neffort that cannot be presumed.  \nMyth: Candidate rich market means that I will be able to find the talent I need. \nReality: As the economy continues to improve, pent up demand for top performers will \nprevail and the best candidates will be hired quickly.  There are never enough high \nperformers in the marketplace.    \nMyth: Keeping salaries low is expected in this economy. \nReality: Retaining top staff requires that salaries remain competitive within the sector or \nyour best staff will leave to another organization where salaries are higher.  If you lose \ngood staff, the cost to your organization is enormous.    \nMyth: Putting off hiring key staff will save us money. \nReality: The truth is that putting off hiring the staff you need only postpones programs \nand services and promotes missed opportunities to hire incredible employees.  If you wait \ntoo long, someone else will hire the best staff and not you.    \nMyth: Doubling up on jobs is an efficient way to get through the year. \nReality: One of the most inefficient ways to run an organization is to double up on jobs \nproducing poor work, low morale, and a very tired team.  \nMyth: Staffing contracts are only for very large organizations that hire many temps. \nReality: Low cost contracts are available to both large and small organizations regardless \nof the number of temps needed by an organization. \nMyth: There is no way to reduce risk when hiring a new employee.   \nReality:  PNP’s one year guarantee on any Direct Hire placement reduces the risk you \ntake when hiring a new employee.  \nMyth: Finding an Interim Executive is difficult, time consuming, and not essential.   \nReality:  An organization’s ability to function well is impacted when major transitions \noccur.  Having the right Interim Executive can make that transition smooth and \nproductive, and PNP’s roster of available executives makes it easy. \nWe thank Ventureneer/Stengel Solutions for producing our survey.

We\n      now project a substantial surplus for 2011.\n    • Our financial position has improved considerably,  and  we  have  been\n      happy with the productivity of our temporarily larger (7-person) team.\n      We will be seeking to expand the team further, hoping for at least one\n      new hire - and possibly two - in 2012.\n    • Our reserves policy is not triggered. (See the bottom two rows of  the\n      2011 cash flow projection, for October and November.) However,  it  is\n      close to being  triggered,  and  a  less  conservative  (i.e.,  lower)\n      projection for our forward expenses would trigger  it.  Note  that  we\n      have conservatively budgeted for two new hires starting  in  April  of\n      2012.\n    • We still project a substantial deficit for 2012, but this is based  on\n      a very conservative revenue  projection.  We  expect  the  deficit  to\n      narrow substantially with relatively little fundraising effort on  our\n      part, and if it doesn't we will ramp up our fundraising effort.\n\n  Year-to-date budget vs. actual, with notes on changes to projected budget\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n\n\n\n                          Projected cash flow: 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n                          Projected cash flow: 2012\n\n\n\n\n[pic]\n"

          "title": "Progress Report",
          "text": "\n                   GiveWell Progress Report, Mid-Year 2011\n\nOur priorities for the year, as articulated in our annual report,[1] are:\n\n1. Research expansion: finding more top charities (enough to productively\nabsorb $3 million).\n    • We have struggled on this front despite devoting the vast bulk of our\n      resources and attention to it. We discuss our situation in Attachment\n      C.\n    • This will continue to be our overwhelmingly top priority through\n      Thanksgiving of this year.\n    • We have begun work on a new research initiative, but are early in the\n      process and do not expect this initiative to generate concrete\n      recommendations in 2011.\n\n2. Fundraising: raising 2011 revenues to around $400,000.00.\n    • We now project 2011 revenues of around $540,000.00 though not all of\n      this funding is expected to repeat in 2012.\n    • Our reserves policy is not currently triggered, as discussed in\n      Attachment A.\n    • We have de-prioritized fundraising for the time being.\n\n3. Research maintenance and systemization: integrating new hires into our\nprocess and updating our recommendations.\n    • We consider ourselves on track for this goal.\n    • We currently have a 7-person team and are happy with the productivity\n      and management overhead; two of our employees are temporary (leaving\n      at the end of August) and we hope to expand our team more permanently\n      in the coming year.\n    • We don't yet have a plan for recruiting.\n\n4. Research vetting: securing more testimonials and external reviews.\n    • We feel that our testimonials page[2] has improved satisfactorily.\n    • Progress has been relatively slow on securing external reviews. We\n      plan to raise the priority of this front after Thanksgiving.\n\n5. Marketing: pursuing low-hanging fruit to increase our influence.\n    • We have made substantial progress on many of the \"low-hanging fruit\"\n      avenues we listed:\n         o Improving search engine optimization and search engine\n           marketing: we have enrolled in the Google Grants program,\n           substantially increased our advertising, and seen improved\n           search engine traffic due largely to optimized blog posts. We\n           are in the process of hiring a contractor to help us further in\n           this category.\n         o Earned media: our work on disaster relief, which we published in\n           January, positioned us to make public recommendations for this\n           year's crises in Japan and East Africa. In the former case, our\n           recommendations received substantial press[3] and in both cases\n           we have seen increased web traffic during these periods.\n         o Website improvements, including better integration of social\n           media (Facebook, Twitter, Google+), a \"donation reminder\" box\n           (though we've seen very little use of this), and an ongoing\n           server and CMS upgrade.\n         o We have been experimenting with different types of community\n           events. We held a fundraising/awareness event targeting our\n           former employer on April 28 in Westport, and are holding a\n           research-focused community event on August 18 in NYC.\n    • Statistics on our impact, updated quarterly, are now available at\n      http://www.givewell.org/about/impact .\n         o Traffic was up 87% from last year's Q1 to this year's, and 209%\n           from last year's Q2 to this year's. These improvements include\n           periods of major coverage of the Japan crisis, and we expect\n           less traffic in the remainder of 2011.\n         o The number of donations through the website is up about 160%\n           from the first half of last year to the first half of this year.\n           Money moved through the website is up about 300% from the first\n           half of last year to the first half of this year. Disaster-\n           related donations play very little role in this improvement.\n         o We don't have a good handle on why the improvement in money\n           moved is so much greater than the improvement in website\n           traffic, but this has been consistently the case going back to\n           early 2010.\n                                    [pic]\n\n                                    [pic]\n\nNote that the above chart excludes December. In all previous years, online\nmoney moved in December has exceeded online money moved in all other months\ncombined.\n\n6. High-level of research of promising new causes. We have not yet\nprogressed significantly on this front, but expect to do so as part of our\nnew research initiative.\n\nNew priority: recruiting. As discussed in Attachment A, we are hoping for 1-\n2 new hires in 2012, and will be placing a moderate emphasis on this goal\nin the short term and a stronger emphasis on it after Thanksgiving.\n-----------------------\n[1] http://blog.givewell.org/2011/02/14/givewells-plan-for-2011-top-level-\npriorities/\n[2] http://www.givewell.org/what-others-are-saying\n[3] http://www.givewell.org/press#Othernotablecoverage\n\n"

          "text": "\n                   GiveWell Research Update - August 2011\n\n                                   Summary\n\n    • GiveWell's top priority for 2011 is finding additional outstanding\n      giving opportunities for donors.\n    • We intend to publish our updated recommendations and rankings by\n      Thanksgiving 2011.\n    • During 2011, we've considered over 450 additional organizations and\n      contacted more than 40 for an in-depth review.\n    • We have not found organizations that we are extremely confident in. At\n      this point:\n         o We have 10 organizations we consider \"contenders\" for our top\n           ranking.\n         o We think that the Against Malaria Foundation is the most likely\n           organization to receive our top ranking at the end of the year.\n         o We do not believe we will identify new organizations to contact\n           before the end of the year; the 40 organizations we are\n           currently reviewing in depth likely comprise the full set of\n           organizations that could potentially receive our top ranking\n           this year.\n\n\n            Background: focusing on potential top-rated charities\n\n\n    • We have shifted our long-term goal from (a) creating a menu of top\n      charities by cause to (b) identifying the best organizations we can,\n      regardless of cause and reducing our focus on cause-specific analysis\n      when it is not geared towards finding a charity we could rank #1.[1]\n    • At the end of 2010, VillageReach was our #1-ranked organization and it\n      had limited room for more funding. We believe that funding is not\n      currently a bottleneck to further expansion of VillageReach’s program,\n      and it needs approximately $1 million more over the next 3 years to\n      fully fund its project. GiveWell directed more than $1 million to\n      VillageReach in 2010, and based on VillageReach’s room for more\n      funding, we would not want to move that amount to them again this\n      year.\n    • Our focus this year is on finding more charities that we can recommend\n      as strongly as we have VillageReach. For a variety of reasons, we\n      believe that VillageReach may have been a unique opportunity for\n      donors. It had a combination of:\n         o a program with strong evidence of effectiveness focused on\n           immunizations, a highly cost-effective, proven intervention\n         o which VillageReach needed funding to scale up further\n         o but it was struggling to find funding from traditional,\n           institutional donors\n         o even though, were it to work, it could had high upside by\n           potentially altering the way health supplies are distributed\n           across the developing world\n    • So, while our goal is to find a charity as strong as VillageReach, we\n      believe that those opportunities may not arise for individual donors\n      every year.\n\n\n                                 Our process\n\n\n    • Our process has become considerably less \"rigid\" this year. We are\n      focused on finding a potential #1 charity, i.e., a charity that we are\n      excited to promote. We have expanded the set of things we consider\n      \"signs of a charity worth investigating\" and we have become more open-\n      ended in our initial conversations with charities. However, we still\n      work toward answering the same set of questions: what do they do,\n      what's the evidence that it works, how cost-effective is it, and\n      what's the room for more funding.\n    • In general, we try to cast the net as wide as we can and \"scan\" (i.e.,\n      briefly consider) as many organizations as we can. This year, in\n      addition to reconsidering the close-to-400 international charities\n      already listed on our site, we considered an additional approximately\n      450 charities we found by:\n         o Referrals: organizations submitted to us via the form on our\n           website or emails. These come from the charities themselves or\n           donors interested in the charity.\n         o Organiations supported by foundations such as the Gates\n           Foundation or Skoll Foundation which have a focus on\n           international aid\n         o Organizations recommended by academics such as the ones listed\n           on the site for Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee’s book Poor\n           Economics\n    • We narrow the list down using heuristics. In the past we looked for\n      organizations that either (a) focused on our “priority programs”\n      (i.e., programs with strong evidence of effectiveness) or (b)\n      published significant monitoring and evaluation information on their\n      websites. This year, we’ve also flagged organizations for the\n      following: (Note that these are flags we use and we have not\n      necessarily identified an organization in each category.)\n         o Having high potential upside. This includes (a) the possibility\n           of extremely high cost-effectiveness; (b) organizations that aim\n           to use donations today to become self-sustaining such that they\n           do not need donations in the future; (c) organizations running\n           and evaluating their programs such that if they fail, it will\n           create knowledge about whether the type of program they’re\n           trying works or not; and (d) organizations aiming to invent new\n           technologies\n         o Learning organizations. Organizations that can demonstrate that\n           they are monitoring their activities and learning from what goes\n           well such that they continually improve\n         o Low insulation. Organizations that work closely with a\n           particular group of people, and appear to be willing and able to\n           understand and respond to these people's needs and feedback\n           (rather than implementing pre-determined programming).\n         o Local healthcare. Organizations set up to provide basic\n           healthcare where it is lacking.\n         o Orphans and vulnerable children. Organizations focused on\n           providing basic services to children with limited resources /\n           adult support.\n         o Providing basic needs such as water, sanitation, electricity, or\n           shelter.\n    • Once we’ve flagged organizations, we decide which organizations to\n      contact. We do this by ordering the organization by priority (i.e.,\n      the likelihood we assign to an organization ultimately being our #1-\n      ranked organization).\n    • As part of this exercise, staff periodically rank their top 30\n      charities. In this exercise, we try to not focus just on GiveWell’s\n      predetermined criteria and charities but imagine which 30 charities we\n      would give to if we had to. This exercise has helped us identify some\n      organizations we weren’t previously prioritizing.\n    • As our staff has increased, we’ve been able to contact more\n      organizations. We learn a great deal from a single 1-2 hour\n      conversation with a charity representative, ideally the CEO.\n    • Earlier in the year, we invested a lot of time in each charity we\n      contacted, trying to get to a full, in-depth review and investigation\n      before moving on. We decided that this approach was causing us to sink\n      too much time into each organization and that our time would be better\n      spent having initial conversations (from which we learn a lot) with\n      more organizations. Now, we stop investigating organizations once we\n      believe their chances of becoming our #1 organization are sufficiently\n      low, and move onto others that we know less about.\n\n\n                               Where we stand\n\n\n   The charities we've  examined  have  mostly  fallen  into  the  following\n   categories:\n      •  Charities  aiming  to  create  businesses  or  systems  that  will\n        eventually become self-sustaining. In most cases we've had concerns\n        about these groups' models and have not seen evidence of any  track\n        record of reaching sustainability in the past (even for subsets  of\n        their activities).\n      • Charities focused directly on raising incomes. We haven't seen  any\n        such groups with what we consider  to  be  strong  data  indicating\n        effectiveness, or groups whose models we  consider  to  be  clearly\n        more promising than cash transfers. (We have encountered  one  cash\n        transfer-focused charity but it is very  young  and  has  no  track\n        record at this time.)\n      • Charities focused on research &  development  of  new  technologies\n        (health or otherwise). We haven't been able to get a clear sense of\n        room for more funding for any of these groups,  but  feel  that  we\n        still may in the future.\n      •  Charities  focused  on  delivering  basic  healthcare  or   health\n        technologies  (insecticide-treated  net  distribution,   deworming,\n        etc.) We find these groups to be  most  promising  because  of  the\n        relatively strong track record  and  cost-effectiveness  of  health\n        aid. However, we haven't found any groups that we consider to  meet\n        the gold standard in answering our key questions.\n\nWe haven't found any charities that have a truly compelling data-based  case\nfor impact. We've largely evaluated charities by a combination  of  (a)  how\npromising their program area is; (b) their room for more funding, i.e.,  the\nextent to which donations seem likely to fund promising activities; (c)  the\nextent to which their representatives seem to be asking  critical  questions\nand working toward having better evidence regarding effectiveness.\n\n-----------------------\n[1] http://blog.givewell.org/2011/02/04/givewells-annual-self-evaluation-\nand-plan-a-big-picture-change-in-priorities/\n\n"

          "text": "\n           GiveWell's Financial Situation as of December 15, 2011\n\nSummary\n\n    • GiveWell intends to expand substantially over the coming year. We  are\n      having increasing influence and increasing research depth, as well  as\n      launching  a  new  initiative  (GiveWell  Labs)   that   will   create\n      substantially more work. We believe we can productively use more staff\n      to increase our capacity.\n    • Based on current projections, GiveWell projects  a  small  surplus  in\n      2012, and has a reasonable level of cash-on-hand. In the  short  term,\n      we can expand without needing to identify new revenue sources.\n    • GiveWell will need to fundraise and find new revenue sources in  order\n      to maintain the size we hope to reach in mid-2012. Our projected  2013\n      deficit (based on current revenue sources) is $100,000-$200,000.\n    • GiveWell has an  \"excess  assets\"  policy,  specifying  that  once  we\n      surpass a certain level of  unrestricted  assets,  we  grant  out  the\n      excess to top charities rather than continue  to  hold  it  ourselves.\n      This policy is intended to ensure that donors  to  GiveWell  need  not\n      worry about our room for more funding: when we have more than  we  can\n      productively use ourselves, the result is  more  grants  to  the  best\n      charities we've found.\n\nThe case for expansion\n\nOur view, which we will discuss in more detail when doing our formal  annual\nself-evaluation in January 2011, is that GiveWell should be expanding.\n\n    • Our influence is growing rapidly.\n         o Donations to top charities tracked through the  website  are  up\n           about 200-300% in 2011 vs. 2010 (and in 2010 they were up  about\n           200% vs. 2009). For 2011, we project well  over  $1  million  in\n           donations through the website and well over $2 million in  total\n           donations to our top charities, counting only  donors  who  give\n           $250,000 and under (larger donors  are  now  being  tracked  and\n           dealt with  differently,  as  discussed  under  \"GiveWell  Labs\"\n           below). Given that we are still growing significantly,  that  we\n           have stuck to only a basic level of outreach efforts,  and  that\n           GiveWell-using donors are substantially younger than  a  typical\n           donor base, we expect these figures to rise significantly in the\n           future.\n         o Growth is robust: there has  also  been  strong  growth  in  the\n           number of donations (also up 200-300% in  2011  vs.  2010  after\n           only growing ~50% between 2010 and  2009).  Website  traffic  is\n           also up significantly year over year ( > 100% growth in 2011 vs.\n           2010).\n         o We have also gained credibility among academics  and  funders  -\n           partly because  of  our  growing  impact  on  donations,  partly\n           because of our improved network, and partly because of  specific\n           work we've done (for example, publishing substantial analysis of\n           the funding needs for the March 2011 relief effort in Japan  and\n           finding  major  errors  in  World  Health   Organization   cost-\n           effectiveness estimates).\n    • Our access is improving. Because of the  above,  our  ability  to  get\n      charities and scholars to engage  with  us  is  improving,  giving  us\n      access to a lot more information that we need the capacity to  analyze\n      and incorporate into our research.\n    • Our level of depth is increasing. For our 2011  top  charities,  we've\n      done far  more  investigation  and  analysis  than  for  previous  top\n      charities, including  extended  pre-recommendation  field  visits  and\n      detailed original cost-effectiveness analysis (we no  longer  rely  on\n      World Health Organization estimates now that we've  found  substantial\n      problems with them). We find this additional analysis to be  important\n      in making the best recommendation possible,  which  is  becoming  more\n      important with our higher profile and greater impact on donations.\n    • GiveWell Labs is a promising initiative that will create  a  lot  more\n      work. In addition to seeing growing  influence  among  $250k-and-under\n      donors, we now have relationships with a few people who are capable of\n      giving  greater  amounts,  and  we   have   launched   GiveWell   Labs\n      (http://blog.givewell.org/category/givewell-labs/)  to  better   serve\n      this audience (as well as  to  find  better  giving  opportunities  in\n      general). $1 million has been pre-committed to  this  initiative.  The\n      research process will be distinct from (though will have some  overlap\n      with) our core work  of  finding  great  charities,  and  may  involve\n      investigations into many causes we haven't previously covered.\n    • Our ability to hire and manage new talent is  improving.  All  of  the\n      above point to a need for more capacity. Fortunately, we feel we  have\n      developed good processes for identifying and managing new  talent.  In\n      the summer of 2011,  we  worked  productively  with  a  7-person  team\n      including two temporary hires; we are looking to get back up  to,  and\n      perhaps a bit above, this staff size. As of mid-January 2011, we  will\n      have 5 people on staff, all with strong and substantial track  records\n      of contributing to GiveWell.\n\nProjected expenses and revenues - Nov. 2011 through Dec. 2012\n\nAs of December 15, 2011, our latest completed financial report is as of  the\nend of October 2011 (the November report is in progress). Thus,  we  present\nour financial situation and projections starting  November  1;  however,  we\nestimate \"future expenses/revenues\" following this date taking into  account\nmajor actual expenses and revenues between 11/1/11 and 12/15/11.\n\n[pic]\n\nNotes:\n    • We anticipate one new full-time hire,  or  two  new  part-time  hires,\n      starting in February 2012.  We  anticipate  two  new  full-time  hires\n      starting  July  2012.  This  timing  is  because  our  most  promising\n      prospects are college seniors, who we expect to be available  starting\n      in the summer.\n    •  Because  of  our  improved  access  (discussed  above),  we  now  see\n      substantial opportunities to travel for to meet with  specific  people\n      who can contribute to our research process.  We  have  thus  allocated\n      $5,000 for non-field-visit-related travel, in addition to $15,000  for\n      field visits (we spent $10,000 in 2011  on  two  field  visits:  three\n      staff went to Malawi and two went to Delhi).\n    • $40,000 of our projected revenue over this period is  one-time  (i.e.,\n      it will not repeat in future years).  Another  $100,000  is  projected\n      from the Hewlett Foundation, but we cannot be assured of  the  William\n      and Flora Hewlett Foundation's support, particularly since its CEO  is\n      soon stepping down.\n    • On the other hand, we will probably  see  some  unanticipated  revenue\n      over this period as well.\n\nNeeds after 2012\n\nWe project a small surplus  over  2012,  but  2013  projected  expenses  are\n$584,355.57, more if we want to continue expanding ($584,355.57 is based  on\na staff size of 8, which we hope to reach around mid-2012). Because not  all\nof the 2012 revenue is  expected  to  recur  in  the  future  (as  discussed\nabove), we have a projected gap of $100,000-$200,000 (depending  on  whether\nwe retain the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation's support) that  we  need\nto close by then to avoid deficits.\n\nThus, while we consider ourselves to be in a strong financial position  with\nthe ability to expand as warranted, it is also necessary for us to  continue\nto fundraise and identify new revenue sources.\n\n\"Excess assets\" policy\n\nGiveWell has an \"excess assets\" policy, specifying that once  we  surpass  a\ncertain level of unrestricted  assets,  we  grant  out  the  excess  to  top\ncharities rather  than  continue  to  hold  it  ourselves.  This  policy  is\nintended to ensure that donors to GiveWell need not  worry  about  our  room\nfor more funding: when we have more than we can productively use  ourselves,\nthe result is more grants to the best charities we've found.\n\nWe seek to hold a reasonable level of assets: one that gives  us  a  stable,\npredictable financial situation and the ability to  plan  and  to  take  any\noutstanding  opportunities  that  come  up  (particularly  with  regard   to\nhiring). Assets beyond what we feel we need in order to accomplish this  are\ngranted        out.         Details         are         available         at\nhttp://www.givewell.org/about/official-records/Excess-Assets-Policy\n\n\n"

We are aiming for daily blog posts through the  end\nof the calendar year, and will be focusing on these  as  well  as  continued\ndonor relations/maintenance until January, at which point we will begin  our\nannual self-evaluation.\n\nGrowth in influence continues to be strong:\n    • Donations tracked directly through  the  website  continue  to  be  up\n      between 300% and 400% over 2010 (this holds for December  specifically\n      as well as for the rest of the year).

This post summarizes what changed for\nGiveWell in 2011 and what it means for the future. Future posts will\nelaborate.\n\nFor us, the major developments of 2011 were:\n\n• New contacts with major donors and the launch of GiveWell Labs. Prior to\n 2011, we had only one contact whom we would have classified as a\n “megadonor,” i.e., someone who seemed to have a reasonable chance of making\n extremely large gifts (in the range of $1 million or more) in the\n reasonably near future if we could generate good enough giving\n opportunities. In 2011, we made contact with several more, including Good\n Ventures.\n We realized that these contacts made it both more possible and more\n important to produce research of use to major philanthropists. We therefore\n launched GiveWell Labs, a new arm of our research process that will be open\n to any giving opportunity, no matter what form and what sector. GiveWell\n Labs made little progress in 2011 aside from being launched, but we expect\n it to be a major priority for 2012.\n• Our money moved grew significantly, hitting $5 million for 2011. This was\n partly a function of the major donors mentioned above, but partly a\n function of continuing to see strong growth in money moved from smaller\n donors. Excluding GiveWell Labs and Good Ventures, our money moved figure\n roughly doubled over last year, which was consistent with the growth we’ve\n seen in past years.\n• Our general level of “access” improved significantly. By “access,” we\n mean the ability to get relevant people (including charity staff,\n foundation staff, and academics) to engage with us and discuss relevant\n issues. This makes it possible to learn about relevant issues more quickly,\n improving both the quality and speed of our research, and reduces the\n problem of missing potential top charities because of their reluctance to\n engage with us.\n We believe that our access improved partly because of our relatively strong\n “money moved” figure for 2010, which we highlighted on our new For\n Charities page, and partly because of our improved reputation and network.\n Good Ventures has been very helpful on this front.\n• Our needs (and opportunities) for more staff are growing. Over the summer\n of 2011, we had 7 total staff (2 of them temporary) and still felt that we\n could benefit from more capacity. We currently have 5 total staff. Prior to\n 2011, we had never had more than 4 total staff at one time.\n As we become more systematic and thorough, we see more opportunities to\n improve our research by hiring; GiveWell Labs may introduce the need for\n more capacity as well. And the increased level of attention we get has\n increased administrative work.\n Recruiting will be a major priority for 2012.\n• We were successful in raising more operating funding. Fundraising was\n our #2 priority for 2011. We met our goal, with some help from both\n institutions and individuals. We balanced our budget for 2011 and project a\n balanced budget for 2012; if we succeed in making more good hires, we will\n need to raise more to cover our costs for 2013.\n• We identified two strong top charities and intensified our focus on\n global health and nutrition. Identifying top charities was what took the\n most effort in 2011. We believe it’s no accident that all of the strongest\n charities we’ve found so far are within the broad area ofglobal health and\n nutrition. We will be focusing on this area intensively in 2012; we believe\n that deeply investigating a set of priority interventions (and the\n organizations that carry them out) is the most promising route to finding\n more outstanding giving opportunities.\n• We drew substantial attention for our work on disaster\n relief (particularly relating to the Japan crisis in March) and errors in\n World Health Organization cost-effectiveness figures. We believe that these\n contributed to our improvements in money moved, website traffic, and\n general reputation. We will continue to maintain our disaster relief\n research and will continue to deeply investigate research questions that\n are important to us.\n\nOverall, it was a very encouraging year. Our work, our reputation and our\ninfluence all improved significantly, and we see substantial room for more\nimprovement. We believe GiveWell now has enough impact to justify its\noperating expenses, and hope to have much more impact in the future.\n\nOf course, we also made plenty of mistakes in 2011, and we’ve recently\nupdated ourshortcomings log to reflect them.\n\n\nTHURSDAY, FEBRUARY 9TH, 2012 AT 2:41 PM\n\nGiveWell annual review: details on GiveWell’s money moved and web traffic\n\n|By Elie                       |[pic] | [pic] |                     |\n\n\nThis is the second post (of six) focused on our self-evaluation and future\nplans.\nThis post lays out highlights from our metrics report for 2011. For more\ndetail, see our full metrics report (PDF).\n1. In 2011, GiveWell moved $5,285,992 to our recommended charities, a\nsignificant increase over past years.\n                                    [pic]\n2. While our #1-ranked charity received the most funding, many\norganizations received significant funding due to our recommendations. Most\nof our money moved went to AMF (our #1-ranked charity as of December 2011),\nwhich received over $2 million. SCI (our #2-ranked charity as of December\n2011) and VillageReach (our top-rated charity through November 2011) both\nreceived more than $600,000. Three additional organizations received more\nthan $75,000 as a result of our recommendation and one other organization\nreceived more than $50,000.\n                                    [pic]\n3. Web traffic continued to grow.\n                                    [pic]\n4. The main sources of increased traffic were Google search (AdWords and\norganic).\n                                    [pic]\n5. The vast majority of our money moved came from a relatively small set of\ndonors giving very large gifts.\n\nGood Ventures grants to our top charities as well as funding to committed\nGiveWell Labs accounted for approximately 1/3 of our total money moved\n($1.75m / $5.3m). Excluding those funds entirely, 55 donors giving $10,000\nor more accounted for 70% of our money moved. In the table below, and in\nthe following analyses of our 55 largest donors, we exclude funding from\nGood Ventures to our top charities and funding committed to GiveWell Labs.\n\n                                    [pic]\n6. These 55 donors tend to be (a) young (for major donors) and (b) most\noften employed in finance or technology. Close to 80% of our money moved\n(about whom we have information) comes from donors who are under the age of\n50; approximately 45% comes from donors under the age of 40. (Note that we\ndid not always know donors’ ages and, in some cases, made our best guess.)\n                                    [pic]\n\n                                    [pic]\n7. These major donors most commonly find GiveWell because they\nare proactively looking for a resource that will enable them to give more\neffectively; otherwise, donors are most likely to learn about us via people\nlike Peter Singer, mentions in the media (either print or online).\n                                    [pic]\n8. Based on the major donors who responded to our survey, approximately 2/3\nof the funding was reallocated from other organizations; approximately 1/3\nwere just beginning to give.\n                                    [pic]\n\n9. Most commonly, funds were reallocated from other international\norganizations.\n\n                                    [pic]\n10. GiveWell’s website now processes more giving than GuideStar’s and about\n42% as much as Charity Navigator’s, though it offers far fewer charities as\noptions. This comparison provides evidence that the growth we saw in 2011\nis due not to generalized increases in online giving or use of charity\nevaluators, but rather to GiveWell-specific factors. (Note that the\nGiveWell figure in this chart includes only what was processed through our\nwebsite - not all money moved - in order to provide a valid comparison to\nthe others, for which we only have online-giving data.)\n                                    [pic]\n\nTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 14TH, 2012 AT 11:40 AM\n\nSelf-evaluation: GiveWell as a donor resource\n\n|By Elie                       |[pic] | [pic] |                     |\n\n\nThis is the third post (of six) we’re planning to make focused on our self-\nevaluation and future plans.\nThis post answers a set of critical questions about the state of GiveWell\nas a donor resource. The questions are the same as last year’s.\nDoes GiveWell provide quality research that highlights truly outstanding\ncharities in the areas it has covered?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2011\n• Internally, we were satisfied with the quality of our research as\n compared to other options for donors.\n• We planned to complete a new round of research focused on international\n aid to find additional top charities.\n• We planned to complete regular updates for VillageReach, our top-rated\n charity in 2009 and 2010 and the first charity to which we moved\n significant (now more than $2 million) funds.\n• We felt a need for more substantial external checks on our research. In\n the previous year, we had several reviews completed, but we believed\n additional reviews were necessary.\n• Our research process was constrained because of our inability to offer\n project-based funding.\nProgress since Feb 2011\n\nIn Feb 2011, we wrote that we hoped for\n\n\n  More intensive examination of our top-rated charities (the ones that\n  attract the lion’s share of our “money moved”), including in-person site\n  visits, continual updates on room for more funding, and conversations with\n  major funders who have agreed - or declined - to fund them.\n\n\nIn 2011, we did all of these things.\n\n• The level of vetting to which we subject our top charities has increased\n significantly.\no We visited all three leading contenders for our highest ratings in\n  October before giving them our top rating. We intend to continue this and\n  visit charities before we give them our top ratings.\no We conducted extensive reviews of the cost-effectiveness and evidence of\n  effectiveness for the programs run by our top charities, which went\n  significantly beyond our independent assessments of research in previous\n  years. (See our writeups onITNs and deworming.)\n• We have completed regular updates on VillageReach’s progress.\n• We have received several additional external reviews of our research, but\n our attempts to significantly expand this process were not successful. We\n intend to revisit this in 2012.\n• In addition, we launched GiveWell Labs, a new arm of our research process\n that will be open to any giving opportunity, no matter what form and what\n sector, in the hopes of improving our ability to find great giving\n opportunities.\nAs our influence has increased, our ability to get access to relevant\npeople such as charity representatives, scholars, and major funders has\nimproved. (For example, see our investigation of targeted vs. universal\ncoverage for insecticide-treated nets.) This, along with growth in our\nteam, have improved our ability to do in-depth research efficiently.\nWhere we stand\nWe feel that our current research is high-quality and up-to-date. We are\nnot satisfied with our total “room for money moved.” We estimate that our\ntop charities have roughly $15-20 million in available room for more\nfunding, which is substantially more than we have directed to them, but not\nnecessarily “enough” if our influence were to continue growing rapidly.\n\nWe also feel there are multiple areas that could offer outstanding\nopportunities that we have not yet researched as thoroughly as we could\n(particularly in the areas of nutrition, vaccinations, neglected tropical\ndisease control, tuberculosis control, and research and development).\n\n\nWe also continue to see room for improvement in our coverage of top\ncharities.\n\n• We’d like to continue to increase our qualitative checks on top\n charities, particularly conversations with those who have funded them or\n chosen not to.\n• We remain unsatisfied with the degree to which our research is “vetted.”\n It still seems to us that we could make a substantial mistake or error in\n judgment, with too high a probability that it would remain unnoticed. We\n feel that this is much less true today than ever before, because (a) our\n staff is larger and we subject important pages to multiple checks from\n different people; (b) our research draws more attention, including from\n donors who are giving large amounts and vetting our work fairly closely. We\n feel that the degree to which our work is “vetted” will grow as our overall\n influence and prominence grows, though putting more effort into formal\n external reviews help as well.\nWhat we can do to improve\n• Revisit the goal of having our work subjected to formal, consistent,\n credible external review.\n• Continue to look for more outstanding giving opportunities for individual\n donors, particularly (a) in the areas we have identified as most promising\n (b) through GiveWell Labs.\nIs it practical for donors to evaluate and use GiveWell’s research in the\nareas it has covered?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2011\n\nLast year, we wrote:\n\n\n  While we have created the basic process and template for both reviews and\n  testimonials, and have some basic evidence of our credibility now easily\n  available, we feel that the content of both pages could be much stronger.\n\nProgress since Feb 2011\n• We held an in-person research event in August 2011 and a conference call\n in December 2011 to publicly discuss our research and field questions. We\n posted audio and transcripts from both meetings. We held these meetings to\n enable donors to ask questions and engage with our research without\n requiring them to read all the details on our website.\n• We substantially improved our collection of testimonials and now feel\n that it is fairly strong.\n• We consolidated different forms of evidence for our credibility, which\n include both the improved collection of testimonials and documentation of\n our greatly improved influence.\n• We completed more external reviews, though we did not progress as far on\n this front as we hoped.\nWhere we stand as of February 2012\nWe feel that evidence of our credibility has substantially improved and is\nnow fairly strong, and that this is part of the reason for our\nincreased money moved.\nWhat we can do to improve\n\nAside from revisiting our approach to external evaluation, we believe the\nmain path to improvement is to continue improving our knowledge of giving\nopportunities and the depth of our research. We also plan to increase the\nfrequency of research meetings and conference calls to help donors engage\nwith our research.\n\nHow much funding can GiveWell’s top-rated charities effectively absorb?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2011\n\nWe estimated that VillageReach, our top-ranked charity at that time, had\ntotal room for more funding in its Mozambique scale up of approximately\n$1.5 million.\n\nProgress since Feb 2011\nWe have identified two additional top charities, each of which has\nsignificant room for more funding.\nWhere we stand as of February 2012\n\nWe believe that AMF could absorb up to $15 million, and SCI could absorb a\nfew million dollars as well.\n\n\nWe have made significant progress on this front in the past 12 months and\nexpect to continue to progress in the next 12 months.\n\nWhat we can do to improve\n\nWe intend to continue to look for more outstanding giving opportunities.\nCurrently, we see the promising avenues to finding these opportunities as\n\n• Deeply investigating the areas we have identified as most promising (such\n as the areas of nutrition, vaccinations, neglected tropical disease\n control, tuberculosis control, and research and development).\n• Moving forward on GiveWell Labs.\nThis marks a change from the strategy we have generally used to date,\nincluding in 2011, ofexamining a large number of charities and deeply\ninvestigating the ones that stand out. All of the strongest opportunities\nwe have found to date (VillageReach, AMF and SCI) are groups focusing on\nproven health/nutrition interventions that themselves have strong evidence\nbases; this greatly improves the ability of these charities to make a\nstrong case (more discussion at our 2011 post on the appeal of global\nhealth and nutrition).\n\nWe feel that by focusing on the areas of aid with the strongest evidence\nbases and deeply understanding them, we are likely to find more outstanding\ngiving opportunities; examining charities outside these areas appears at\nthis point to have lower potential returns.\n\n\nThis does not mean we are closing ourselves off to the possibility of\nrecommending charities in other areas. We have some particular promising\ncharities in other areas on our list to investigate, and we expect to\ncontinue to have an “open submission process” such that any charity has the\nopportunity to make a case to us. However, we will likely raise the bar for\n“what it takes for us to investigate a charity outside our priority areas,”\nand we will likely focus on priority areas for at least the coming year.\n\n\nTHURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16TH, 2012 AT 11:47 AM\n\nSelf-evaluation: GiveWell as a project\n\n|By Elie                       |[pic] | [pic] |                     |\n\n\nThis is the fourth post (of six) we’re planning to make focused on our self-\nevaluation and future plans.\nThis post answers a set of critical questions for GiveWell stakeholders.\nThe questions are the same as last year’s.\nIs GiveWell’s research process “robust,” i.e., can it be continued and\nmaintained without relying on the co-Founders?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2011\n\nWe had two full-time, non-co-founder employees (analysts), a part-time\nemployee, and plans to hire another in the summer. We wrote that, in total,\nwe expected to have 3.5 analysts by the Fall of 2011.\n\nProgress since Feb 2011\n\nBy the summer of 2011, we had 3 full-time analysts and two temporary summer\nanalysts. One of our full-time analysts left in December 2011; we recently\nhired one of our former summer analysts, bringing us back to 3 full-time\nanalysts.\n\n\nThe analysts have been with us different levels of time, but as they have\nbeen at GiveWell longer, each has continued to take on more responsibility.\n\nWhere we stand as of February 2012\n\nWe currently have 3 full-time analysts, and have made an offer to an\nanalyst who will start in July, which would bring GiveWell to 4 full-time\nanalysts. We continue to focus on recruiting and hope to reach 6 full-time\nanalysts (8 total employees) summer 2012.\n\nAnalysts take the lead on most charity investigations; co-founders may\nprovide basic guidance and sign off on work before it is\npublished. GiveWell Labs, because of its experimental nature, will be led\nfor the time being by co-founders.\nWhat we can do to improve\n• We continue to experience turnover. Two analysts who worked with us in\n 2011 have since left GiveWell. We don’t believe that turnover is indicative\n of a problem – GiveWell is a unique environment that fits some people and\n not others and we would not be surprised if turnover remains relatively\n high in the near future. We have tried to address turnover by improving our\n hiring process to select for the characteristics most likely to lead to\n success at GiveWell.\n• In the past, we have exclusively hired “generalists” i.e., young, largely\n college-graduates who work on a little bit of everything at GiveWell –\n e.g., charity reviews, speaking with donors, answering emails, in-depth\n literature reviews. In the coming year, we plan on putting more thought\n into hiring people for more specialized roles, such as administration (we\n now have enough administrative work for a full-time hire) and literature\n reviews.\nDoes GiveWell present its research in a way that is likely to be persuasive\nand impactful (i.e., is GiveWell succeeding at “packaging” its research)?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2011\n\nWe wrote, “We’re currently satisfied with the presentation of our content\nand don’t plan on emphasizing this goal in the near future.”\n\nProgress since Feb 2011\n\nNone. This was not a priority over the past 12 months.\n\nWhere we stand as of February 2012\n\nAs traffic to our website has increased over the past 12 months, we would\nguess that the importance of better packaging our research has risen. In\nparticular, we feel our site is poorly suited to donors who want to spend\nmore than a few minutes but less than an hour on our site. (We have\ndesigned the site to make quick action easy and to provide significant\ndepth, but we have no “middle level” of depth for gaining some information\nrelatively quickly.)\n\nWhat we can do to improve\n\nWe have a list of ideas for how to better package our research, and we may\nprioritize this in 2012. In particular, we are considering putting more\nwork into a “middle level of detail” as described above.\n\nDoes GiveWell reach a lot of potential customers (i.e., is GiveWell\nsucceeding at “marketing” its research)?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2011; progress since Feb 2011; where we stand as\nof February 2012\nAs detailed previously, our growth remains robust:\n• We tracked over $5 million to our recommended charities in 2011 compared\n to approximately $1.5 million in 2010.\n• The number of donors who gave to our recommended charities grew by about\n 3x in 2011 compared to 2010.\n• Our website traffic roughly doubled in 2011 compared to 2010.\n\nAs long as we continue to grow at ~2-3x (which continued thus far in 2012),\nwe will consider our growth to be strong, and will not consider outreach to\nbe an urgent priority.\n\nWhat we can do to improve\n\nWe continue to consider ideas to improve our reach, but at this point,\ndon’t feel that increasing our reach is as important as improving the\nquality and packaging of our research (discussed above).\n\nWe feel that the most important strategy for improving our reach is to\ndevelop GiveWell Labs into a strong product, since this would open up a new\naudience that could potentially be an excellent fit with us and make a\nlarge difference for our influence.\n\nWe will maintain two strategies that we feel are effective at bringing\nattention to our work:\n\n• Regular blog posts (we generally aim for one per week). In surveying the\n major donors who comprise the bulk of our money moved, we found that they\n emphasized the blog as a key way that they engage with our work. In\n addition, looking at the sources of growth in ourmetrics report, we believe\n that a substantial amount of our growth in referral traffic is due to\n content we published on the blog.\n• Our research on disaster relief, which we maintain mostly for outreach\n reasons. In 2011, our report on the March crisis in Japan drew significant\n attention (and the associated traffic spike is visible); our report on the\n East Africa famine also drew some attention (a blog post on the topic was\n our third most-trafficked post of the year with over 6000 visits; our top\n two most-trafficked posts were both on the Japan crisis).\nIs GiveWell a healthy organization with an active Board, staff in\nappropriate roles, appropriate policies and procedures, etc.?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2011\n\nWe were happy with our board and policities, but wrote, “we have a\nsignificant need for more operating support and intend to make this a major\npriority for 2011.”\n\n\nWe also wrote:\n\n\n  We aim to raise operating support by\n\n • Applying for support from major institutional funders.\n • Having discussions with people who have a substantial history of being\n   close to our project, including Board members and major “customer donors”\n   (i.e., donors who have used our research to decide where to give), about\n   the possibility of their supporting GiveWell directly.\n\n  We plan to continue to avoid soliciting funds from the public at large. We\n  wish to avoid “competing with” our recommended charities for funding, and\n  feel our credibility would be hindered if we were asking for money\n  ourselves.\n\nProgress since Feb 2011\n\nWe closed our funding gap using the approaches laid out above, raising\nfunds from both institutional funders and “customer donors” who had a\nsubstantial history of being close to GiveWell.\n\nWhere we stand as of February 2012\n\nWe project revenues that will meet expenses for 2012 and currently have\nwhat we consider a safe level of cash reserves. We project a deficit for\n2013 but expect to be able to fund the gap using the strategies laid out\nabove.\n\nWhat we can do to improve\n\nFinancials:\n\n\nWe intend to continue taking opportunities to raise funds for GiveWell\noperations when the opportunities present themselves, but do not intend to\nmake fundraising for GiveWell one of our primary priorities (or uses of\ntime) for 2012.\n\n\nBoard:\n\n\nOur current Board of Directors is more or less the same as it was in 2008.\n2012 may be the right year to consider reorganizing the board.\n\nWhat is GiveWell’s overall impact, particularly in terms of donations\ninfluenced? Does it justify the expense of running GiveWell?\n\nIn 2010, we had expenses of less than $315,000 and money moved of\napproximately $1.5 million, a ratio of 4.8:1. Our loose, long-term target\nwas at least a 9:1 ratio of money moved to operating expenses.\n\n\nIn 2011, we had money moved of over $5 million with expenses of $356,000, a\nratio of 14:1.\n\n$1.75 million of the $5 million came from grants from Good Ventures and pre-\ncommitments to GiveWell Labs, neither of which will necessarily repeat in\n2012. However, the remaining $3.25 million alone would produce an\napproximately 9:1 ratio.\n\nTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21ST, 2012 AT 10:03 AM\n\nGiveWell’s plan for 2012: top-level priorities\n\n|By Holden                           |[pic] | [pic] |               |\n\n\nIn previous posts, we discussed the progress we’ve made, where we stand,\nand how we can improve in core areas. This post focuses on the latter, and\nlays out our top-level strategic choices for the next year.\n\n                               The big picture\n\nBroadly, we see the key aspects of GiveWell - the areas in which we can\nimprove - as\n\n1. Research expansion: finding additional outstanding giving opportunities.\n2. Research maintenance and systemization: keeping our research up to date,\n while allocating as much responsibility as possible to junior staff. This\n includes regular updates on charities that we have directed significant\n funding to.\n3. Research vetting: checking the quality of our research and providing\n evidence for this quality.\n4. Outreach: working to increase awareness of GiveWell, traffic to our\n site, conversion of website traffic into donors and followers, etc.\n5. Fundraising/operating: maintaining the organization.\nThese are broadly similar to the areas for improvement we’ve listed in the\npast. And as in the past, we feel that the first two of these - finding\nmore outstanding giving opportunities and staying up to date on those we’ve\nfound - are at the core of our work and remain our top priorities. The\nbasic reasoning:\n• In 2011, as in 2010, we experienced substantial growth despite not making\n outreach a major priority for the year. We believe this is because\n producing quality research - while taking “low-hanging fruit” on the\n outreach side - leads to strong growth in referral links, organic search\n performance, and word-of-mouth. From surveying our largest donors, we\n believe that it is common for such donors to read our reports relatively\n carefully.\n• We believe that our chances for growing over the long term are highly\n dependent on our providing as much “room for money moved” as we can in the\n most outstanding giving opportunities possible, while doing as much due\n diligence as possible to maintain a strong reputation.\n• Letting up on the quality of our research would be a major risk. A highly\n dedicated effort to outreach would not clearly have greater returns (just\n in terms of attracting attention) than continuing to improve the quality of\n our research.\n\nWe are planning some work on #3-#5 above, but believe that we can perform\nstrongly in both areas without making them major priorities for the year.\n\n                          Our priorities and goals\n#1: make significant progress on GiveWell Labs, the new arm of our research\nprocess that will be open to any giving opportunity, no matter what form\nand what sector. A future post will discuss the specifics of our plans and\nhoped-for progress on GiveWell Labs. This initiative represents a\nsubstantial new opportunity to both find great giving opportunities and\nexpand our potential target audience (more).\n#2: Find more top charities under the same basic framework as our existing\nrecommendations. A future post will elaborate on our plans for this.\nOur current top charities have significant room for more funding, so it\nwould not be catastrophic (though it would be highly undesirable) to end\n2012 without new top charities. Because of this, we view GiveWell Labs as\nslightly more crucial for 2012. However, we plan substantial work on both\nand anticipate that the quality of our standard research will continue to\nimprove significantly.\n#3: Expand our team. We are currently recruiting Research Analysts; we are\nalso thinking about whether hiring for more specialized roles may more\nefficiently increase our capacity. We hope to have at least eight full-time\nemployees by the end of 2012.\nOther goals include:\n• Regular updates on the charities we have moved the most funding to.\n• Putting some time into more deeply investigating research questions that\n are particularly important to us, such as the risks of population growth\n and the benefits of deworming. These sorts of investigations are along the\n lines of the 2011 investigation that ended with our finding major errors in\n cost-effectiveness estimates published by the World Health Organization,\n and rethinking how we use these sorts of figures.\n• Updating our research on disaster relief.\n• Raising any funding needed to finance the expansion of our team.\n• Revisiting our process for having our research subjected to formal\n external review.\n• Improving our process for tracking and processing donations (more).\n• Low-hanging fruit on the “outreach” front:\no Improving our website to reflect some specific feedback we’ve recently\n  gotten.\no Further conference calls and community events to discuss our research\n  (rather than simply writing about it).\no Any other opportunities we see to make reasonable potential gains on the\n  “outreach” front without excessive investment on our part.\n\nWEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 22ND, 2012 AT 1:53 PM\n\nGiveWell’s plan for 2012: specifics of research\n\n|By Holden                           |[pic] | [pic] |               |\n\n\nWe previously laid out our high-level priorities for 2012. The top two\npriorities are “make significant progress on GiveWell Labs” and “find more\noutstanding giving opportunities under the same basic framework as our\nexisting recommendations.” This post elaborates on our plans for these two\npriorities.\nA note on relative priorities: our current top charities have\nsignificant room for more funding, so it would not be catastrophic (though\nit would be highly undesirable) to end 2012 without new top charities.\nBecause of this, we view GiveWell Labs as slightly more crucial for 2012.\nHowever, we plan substantial work on both and anticipate that the quality\nof our standard research will continue to improve significantly.\n                                GiveWell Labs\n\nWe believe that GiveWell Labs is very important for our long-term impact;\nit represents a substantial new opportunity to both find great giving\nopportunities and expand our potential target audience (more).\nHowever, at this time GiveWell Labs is still in the very early stages.\n(We announced it in September, but a few weeks later put our entire focus\non finding top charities in time for 2011’s holiday season.) The stage it’s\nat is somewhat comparable to the stage GiveWell was at in August of 2007;\nand like the GiveWell of 2007, we will probably go through a lot of\nexperimentation, go down some significant dead ends, and possibly miss some\ndeadlines and change our vision of what we’re trying to accomplish. So we\ndon’t want to commit to highly concrete or definite goals at this time.\n\nThat said, here’s our current working framework.\n\nThe building blocks of GiveWell Labs\n\nAs we try to find the best giving opportunities, we believe it will be\nhelpful to work separately on the questions of what the most promising\nsectors (general areas of philanthropy, such as “climate change mitigation”\nor “tuberculosis control” are) vs. what the most promising projects are\nwithin a sector. We’re thinking of GiveWell Labs as being divided into the\nfollowing categories:\n\n1. Completely open-ended, sector-agnostic investigation (example: examining\n data on foundation grants to get a sense for what today’s foundations work\n on).\n2. Basic research to determine how promising a sector is (example:\n investigating climate change in a low-depth way, focusing on determining\n what strategies are open to philanthropists and whether their cost-\n effectiveness could be competitive with other sectors).\n3. In-depth work getting a deep understanding of a particular sector\n (example: trying to gather as many relevant ideas/conversations as possible\n for tuberculosis control).\n4. Researching a particular project, or kind of project, to determine\n whether to recommend it.\n\nThere is some justification for doing the 4 steps sequentially: #1 helps\none choose the right sectors to research (#2), which helps one choose the\nright sectors to focus on (#3), which helps one choose the best projects to\nrecommend (#4). However, there is also some justification for working on\nmultiple tracks in parallel: learning more about specific projects and\nspecific sectors will probably inform the way we go about deciding between\nsectors, and there are some sectors we already know well enough to consider\nthem high-priority. In addition, we don’t ever expect to have final or\nrigid choices of the most promising sectors, and will always be open to\nparticularly promising projects from any sector.\n\nGoals for 2012\nWithin GiveWell Labs, our current (and very much subject to change) top\ngoal for 2012 is getting a good working understanding of the most promising\nsectors, which means making significant headway on #1 and #2 above. Our\nsecond-most important goal is to get an in-depth understanding of the\nlandscape of giving opportunities in at least one sector, likely one\nwithinglobal health and nutrition (which we believe we already know enough\nabout to consider it a highly promising area of philanthropy). Our third-\nmost important goal is to recommend a specific project to fund, but we\nthink it’s very possible that we won’t get this far in 2012, i.e., that\nwe’ll end the year with some good and durable insights regarding “where to\nlook” but without a specific project recommendation yet.\n                         Finding more top charities\nFinding more top charities is also very important to the long-term impact\nof GiveWell.\n• If we grow as much as we hope, we will run out of room for more\n funding for our current top charities within a few years. (This is,\n however, unlikely to happen within the year.)\n• Researching more top charities is also our core method for improving the\n general quality of our research, by learning more about the most promising\n areas of aid.\nIn 2011, our main strategy for finding top charities was to consider as\nmany charities as we could, and deeply investigate those that showed signs\nof promise. (More on our process.) We expect our 2012 strategy to be quite\ndifferent.\nAll of the best charities we’ve found so far (VillageReach, AMF and SCI)\nare within the broad area of global health and nutrition. Furthermore, all\nfocus on interventions that have substantial evidence bases behind them -\nthe kind of evidence bases that, as far as we can tell, are found only\nwithin global health and nutrition.\nThe set of interventions that we feel have substantial, encouraging\nevidence bases behind them is fairly contained. The main such interventions\nare immunization campaigns, insecticide-treated bednets, control\nof neglected tropical diseases, nutrition interventions (particularly those\nfocused on micronutrients), and tuberculosis control interventions. Water-\nquality-focused interventions may qualify as a “priority sector” as well;\nwe would need to do more work before declaring it to be one.\nIn the past, we have struggled to identify good giving opportunities in\nthese areas, largely because of concerns over room for more funding - the\nmajor organizations working in these areas tend to be large and diverse,\nand we haven’t been satisfied with our prospects of connecting donations to\nactivities. However, we think there is a possibility that we will be able\nto address this problem by working more intensively with these\norganizations - to better understand them and, if necessary, to use some\nform of restricted funding in order to make sure that GiveWell-sourced\ndonations have a true effect on GiveWell-recommended activities.\nIf we can do this, we feel our chances of finding more good giving\nopportunities are significant. By contrast, we are pessimistic about our\nchances of finding great charities by continuing ourbroad outreach; we have\nalready examined a large number of the most promising charities and don’t\nsee much potential in the majority of those that remain on our\nlist. Therefore, we expect to spend more time in 2012 on intensive\ninvestigations of large charities working in priority areas than on broad\noutreach to many charities.\n\nSome caveats to this statement:\n\n• We want to maintain an “open door” for any demonstrably outstanding\n organization, even if it doesn’t fit into our pre-defined priority areas.\n We will likely raise the bar for what it takes to consider an organization\n “promising” when it is outside of our priority areas, but we will maintain\n a process by which any charity can submit information and be considered.\n (Note that we’ve recently updated our charity submission form.)\n• There are a small number of charities that we are currently in the\n process of investigating and find quite promising, despite not being in\n priority interventions. We intend to continue these investigations and\n conclude them by holiday season of 2012.\n• We expect to follow a 2011-style “examine many charities” strategy again\n in the future. We want to make sure that we maintain a relatively up-to-\n date understanding of what sorts of organizations are out there, and this\n means casting a wide net periodically - just not necessarily every year.\n\nWe hope to identify at least one new outstanding giving opportunity for\nindividual donors in 2012\n\n\n"

Although \nsome executives believe these challenges will continue into 2010, most feel \nthat, despite some continuing hardships, their organization’s future is brighter \nthan expected. \nOur NY survey respondents reported a belief in the continuation of a slow and \ngradual recovery and substantial opportunities for organizations that are able to adapt. \nNonprofit leaders understand that they need to be able to navigate through short \nterm challenges so that they can later take advantage of longer term opportunities. \nIt is important for an organization to position itself now for the next stage of the \nrecovering economy.  From our survey this year, it is evident that NY nonprofit \nmanagers are doing exactly that.  A significant number of you have continued your \ncommitment to programs and services and are beginning to hire staff that was laid \noff, filling vacancies, as well as adding new positions.   \nNY organizations, on the whole, maintained salaries at pre-2009 levels and, for \nsome specialties, increased compensation.  Fundraising salaries rose by about 10% and \nhigh level finance salaries increased by about 7%. \nManagers noted that it was difficult to find the talent they needed in the \nmarketplace so when they did, they paid a little more. Even when doing more with \nless is the rule rather than the exception, hiring and maintaining outstanding talent is \nstill the most critical issue for every organization. \nIn year 2009, NY organizations also reported the following: \n39% laid-off staff; 61% did not lay off any staff \n50% froze salaries; 50% offered slight pay increases where appropriate \n22% reduced benefits; 78% continued benefits as is  \n19% reduced programs; 81% continued to provide all programs & services \n24% hired staff to fill critical vacancies \nTemps now represent a large portion of overall employment.  It has become \nimpossible to work without a good reliable temp workforce to lean on. 3327 PNP SALARY SURVEY NY09:Layout 1  2/2/10  1:47 PM  Page 1\n\nASSOCIATIONS, EDUCATION & ARTS ORGANIZATIONS

priority. As organizations position \nthemselves to compete for resources, hiring and retaining the best staff may be the \ndifference between an organization’s success or failure. \nMyth:  No need to worry about staff retention – no one is going anywhere. \nReality: High performing staff, a limited resource, is always hard to find.  Competition for \ntop talent between similar organizations is fierce.  Retaining the best staff is an ongoing \neffort that cannot be presumed.  \nMyth: Candidate rich market means that I will be able to find the talent I need. \nReality: As the economy continues to improve, pent up demand for top performers will \nprevail and the best candidates will be hired quickly.  There are never enough high \nperformers in the marketplace.    \nMyth: Keeping salaries low is expected in this economy. \nReality: Retaining top staff requires that salaries remain competitive within the sector or \nyour best staff will leave to another organization where salaries are higher.  If you lose \ngood staff, the cost to your organization is enormous.    \nMyth: Putting off hiring key staff will save us money. \nReality: The truth is that putting off hiring the staff you need only postpones programs \nand services and promotes missed opportunities to hire incredible employees.  If you wait \ntoo long, someone else will hire the best staff and not you.    \nMyth: Doubling up on jobs is an efficient way to get through the year. \nReality: One of the most inefficient ways to run an organization is to double up on jobs \nproducing poor work, low morale, and a very tired team.  \nMyth: Staffing contracts are only for very large organizations that hire many temps. \nReality: Low cost contracts are available to both large and small organizations regardless \nof the number of temps needed by an organization. \nMyth: There is no way to reduce risk when hiring a new employee.   \nReality:  PNP’s one year guarantee on any Direct Hire placement reduces the risk you \ntake when hiring a new employee.  \nMyth: Finding an Interim Executive is difficult, time consuming, and not essential.   \nReality:  An organization’s ability to function well is impacted when major transitions \noccur.  Having the right Interim Executive can make that transition smooth and \nproductive, and PNP’s roster of available executives makes it easy. \nWe thank Ventureneer/Stengel Solutions for producing our survey.

          "text": "\nThis document was sent out as preparation for an  August  9  GiveWell  Board\nmeeting. The basic conclusion reached was that\n    • GiveWell continues to prioritize research aimed at finding outstanding\n      giving opportunities for  individual  donors.  GiveWell  continues  to\n      place a high importance on providing enough of these opportunities  to\n      keep up with demand.\n    • GiveWell's research process is evolving and becoming more \"foundation-\n      like\" in some ways, while remaining distinct from the work of existing\n      foundations  in  tangible  ways,  particularly   our   commitment   to\n      transparency.  The  evolution  of  GiveWell's  research   process   is\n      necessary in order to find the best giving opportunities possible  for\n      all funders, both small and large.\n    • GiveWell will continue to work closely with  Good  Ventures,  and  may\n      prioritize outreach to other potential major-funder partners. However,\n      it does not plan to merge with Good Ventures or to become a consultant\n      to  Good  Ventures  or  any  other  \"major  funder.\"  The  purpose  of\n      GiveWell's working with Good Ventures, and of  outreach  to  potential\n      major funders, is to find people who share GiveWell's core values  and\n      seek to support its mission - not to customize or alter  its  work  to\n      suit major funders.\n\n                                Summary/intro\n\nGiveWell's mission: we find outstanding  giving  opportunities  and  publish\nthe full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give.\n\nGiveWell's  vision:  a  world  in  which  donors  reward  effectiveness   in\nimproving lives.\n\nWe're currently reflecting on which giving opportunities, and which  donors,\nwe should be prioritizing.\n\n    • On the research front, we feel that we've hit diminishing  returns  to\n      our  approach  of  focusing  on   no-strings-attached   donations   to\n      organizations focused on proven cost-effective interventions. In order\n      to find more outstanding giving opportunities, we  may  need  to  \"act\n      more like a foundation\" in terms of considering  giving  opportunities\n      with less evidence behind them  and/or  considering  \"active  funding\"\n      (funding  specific  projects,  rather  than  just  no-strings-attached\n      grants to organizations).\n    • Some of these giving opportunities may  be  better  suited  to  \"major\n      funders\" (giving $1m+ per year) than  to  \"retail  donors\"  (giving  <\n      $250,000 per year). At the moment, we aren't facing much in the way of\n      tradeoffs between serving the two groups, but we recognize that we may\n      in the future, and we're  reflecting  on  which  group  we  should  be\n      prioritizing in principle.\n    • Good Ventures is a \"major funder\"  that  we've  been  working  closely\n      with. Due to the high degree  of  current  overlap  in  our  missions,\n      research priorities, and preferences regarding hiring and managing, we\n      feel there are efficiency gains to close coordination; there are  also\n      potential risks to such coordination.\n    • Good Ventures is the largest \"major funder\" we've  been  working  with\n      and the one with which we've worked  most  closely  but  there  are  a\n      handful of other \"major funders\" with whom we may collaborate.\n\nThis document summarizes what we see  as  our  options  for  addressing  all\nthree issues, and  what  challenges  (including  communications  challenges)\nwould be raised by the different options.\n\nOverriding theme of the change of direction we're contemplating\n\nOn all three fronts, we're contemplating a move in  the  general  conceptual\ndirection of placing higher priority on larger funders and/or on  the  sorts\nof giving opportunities that can appeal to these funders - which means  that\nin some ways GiveWell may come to resemble a foundation more.\n\n\nOur preference is to move in this direction,  while  still  viewing  retail-\ndonor-targeting as a core priority (and hoping to provide enough service  to\nretail donors to keep up with demand). At the same time, we believe we  will\ncontinue to differ, in important ways, from charitable foundations  such  as\nthe Gates Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, etc. Below  we  briefly  summarize\nour vision of the similarities and differences.\n\n\nGiveWell is similar to such foundations in that:\n    • We see our role as helping to allocate particular funds (our \"money\n      moved\") as effectively as possible.\n    • We don't endorse any rigid formula or procedure for determining the\n      best giving opportunities. We are open to using intuition and judgment\n      calls in deciding what to prioritize and what to recommend.\n\nGiveWell is different from such foundations in that our brand is built on\ntransparency. We expect to be held accountable for publishing the full\ndetails and reasoning behind our analysis, and therefore we expect to be\nheld accountable by a broad audience for qualities such as being focused on\nimpact (choosing issue areas and charities based on our judgment of how to\naccomplish the most good, not based on personal passions or personal\nrelationships) and being self-critical.\n\nThrough this distinguishing factor, we believe we can bring a new level of\ncritical inquiry and public debate to charitable giving, which in turn will\nmove toward our vision of a world in which donors reward effectiveness in\nimproving lives.\n\nThe rest of this document goes into  more  detail  on  the  decisions  we're\nfacing and the paths we're considering.\n    Should GiveWell \"act more like a foundation\" in terms of the sorts of\n                    giving opportunities we'll consider?\n\nAs laid out at a recent blog post,\n    • We have previously focused on giving opportunities that are  \"passive\"\n      (we have focused  on  finding  the  best  existing  organizations  and\n      supporting them with no-strings-attached donations, rather than a more\n      \"active\" approach of designing our own strategy, treating charities as\n      partners in carrying out  this  strategy,  and  restricting  donations\n      accordingly)\n    • We have previously focused on giving opportunities  that  are  \"proven\n      cost-effective\" (situations where a donor can be reasonably  confident\n      - based on empirical evidence - that his/her donation will  result  in\n      lives being changed for the better, at a high rate of  \"expected  good\n      accomplished per dollar spent.\")\n    • We feel that we will not find enough outstanding giving  opportunities\n      if  we  retain  these  criteria.  We  are  considering  relaxing  both\n      criteria.\n\nFor     more      detail,      see      the      recent      blog      post:\nhttp://blog.givewell.org/2012/07/20/some-history-behind-our-shifting-\napproach-to-research/\n\nNote that we were considering  project  funding  as  early  as  February  of\n2011;[1] these issues have been becoming  more  salient  for  a  long  time,\nindependently of our relationship with Good Ventures, and we  feel  that  we\nwould be facing this choice regardless of that relationship.\n\nOur options:\n    • Option  1:  retain  both  criteria.  We  would  find  few  new  giving\n      opportunities fitting these criteria; we could potentially reduce  the\n      size of GiveWell and/or deepen our due diligence.\n    • Option 2: relax only one criterion. We could become more open to \"non-\n      proven\" ideas but still provide only  no-strings-attached  support  to\n      organizations. Alternatively, we could stick with  \"proven  effective\"\n      interventions, but become willing to promote them with active funding.\n    • Option 3: relax both criteria.\n    • Option 4: relax both criteria for a subset of  GiveWell,  whose  hours\n      are capped (this is the \"GiveWell Labs\" approach).\n    •  Option  5:  relax  both  criteria,  but  place  a  high  priority  on\n      maintaining enough  \"room  for  more  money  moved\"  in  opportunities\n      meeting these criteria to satisfy demand for such opportunities.\n\nOur preference: Option 5\n\nConsiderations:\n    • In favor of Option 1:\n         o Some donors see us as \"standing above the fray.\"  Higher  levels\n           of subjectivity, and especially \"active\" funding,  could  lessen\n           their trust in GiveWell.\n         o We wouldn't need as much capacity as we currently have. We could\n           shrink GiveWell and/or deepen our due diligence.\n    • In favor of Option 3:\n         o We believe that the best giving opportunities may well  not  fit\n           our existing criteria.\n         o We're personally more excited to explore new areas than  we  are\n           to deepen our due diligence.\n         o Option 3 gives us more appeal for major funders.\n    • Options 2 and 4 may provide ways  to  get  some  of  the  benefits  of\n      expanding without the costs.\n\n\nPotential communication issues:\n    • Most of the language on our website already revolves  around  \"finding\n      outstanding giving opportunities\" rather than \"charity evaluator,\"  so\n      there isn't much that would need to be changed.\n    • We would consider drawing a bright line between  giving  opportunities\n      that fit the original criteria and giving opportunities that don't.\n    • We would need to clearly lay out why we're doing what we're doing.\n\nOpportunities for more investigation:\n    • Survey donors on how they feel about the change and whether  it  would\n      reduce their interest in supporting our top giving opportunities\n\n When in situations where we have to make a tradeoff, should GiveWell target\n                     \"retail donors\" or \"major funders?\"\n\nWe define \"retail donors\" as people capable of giving $250,000 per  year  or\nless. (\"Major funders\" are people capable of giving more.)  At  the  moment,\nwe aren't facing much in the  way  of  tradeoffs  between  serving  the  two\ngroups, but we recognize that we may in the future.\n\nIn addition to questions about whom we should be prioritizing  for  outreach\nand customer service, there are potential research questions as well.  There\nmay be giving opportunities that are a better fit  for  major  funders  than\nfor individual donors (generally when giving needs to happen in a  \"discrete\nchunk,\" i.e., a substantial pool of funds  must  be  committed  at  once  in\norder to allow a  project  to  go  forward.)  We  may  find  mechanisms  for\nenabling individual donors to participate  in  such  opportunities,  but  we\nalso may face tradeoffs.\n\nSome context on giving size:\n    • In 2011, retail donors accounted for $3.25 million in donations to our\n      top charities; in 2012, growth has been slower than in  2011  so  far,\n      but  still  strong  (~150%  year-over-year  growth  as  of  6/30/2012,\n      compared to ~300% year-over-year growth as of 6/30/2011).\n    • Good Ventures gave $1.1 million to our top charities in 2012.\n    • We have relationships with a few other major funders,  giving  in  the\n      range of $1 million per year, possibly more in the future. We are also\n      hoping to form more such relationships through networking.\n\nOur options:\n\nQuestion A: should we focus our resources on giving opportunities that  make\nsense for retail donors?\n    • Option A1: Exclusively  investigate  giving  opportunities  that  make\n      sense for retail donors.\n    • Option A2: Investigate giving opportunities without  regard  to  their\n      fit for retail donors.\n    • Option A3: Cap the hours spent on \"investigating giving  opportunities\n      without regard to their fit for  retail  donors\";  this  guarantees  a\n      minimum allocation to giving opportunities that are a fit.\n    • Option A4: Commit to provide enough outstanding  giving  opportunities\n      for individual donors to absorb all projected \"money moved\" from these\n      donors. Otherwise, investigate giving opportunities without regard  to\n      their fit for retail donors.\n\nOur preference: A4\n\nQuestion B: how much effort should we put into activities  that  are  mostly\ntargeting individual donors: search engine optimization, website  conversion\noptimization, optimizing the online  giving  process,  thank-you  notes  and\nphone calls, answering emails to info@givewell.org,  relationship  building,\nadvertising/media, [what else?]\n\n    • Option B1: go after all  \"low-hanging  fruit\"  (reasonably  high  time\n      allocation)\n    • Option B2: move toward a \"minimum\" needed to \"keep  the  store  open\":\n      automate  thank-you  emails,  keep  the   status   quo   on   donation\n      processing/advertising/website   conversions,   do   not   do   active\n      outreach/relationship building, do not do media outreach  except  when\n      it appears to have very high returns, do not respond to questions sent\n      to info@givewell.org\n    • Option B3: mostly  like  B2,  but  with  a  couple  more  concessions:\n      continue building relationships with donors who give more than $10,000\n      per year, continue answering questions sent to info@givewell.org\n\nOur preference: B3\n\nNote that the following things will be maintained regardless;  these  relate\nto transparency in general, not retail donors specifically.\n    • Publishing the full details of the analysis and  thinking  behind  our\n      recommendations\n    • Regular blog posts\n    • Responding to blog comments\n    • Blogging on relevant topics that are in the news\n\nQuestion C: whom do we approach first about a given giving  opportunity?  Do\nwe publish first and bring in  major  funders  only  after  we've  seen  the\nbehavior of retail donors? Do we shop opportunities to major  funders  first\nand publish later?\n\n    • Option C1: set a consistent hierarchy between retail and major funders\n    • Option C2: approach it on a case-by-case basis,  but  tend  to  go  to\n      retail donors first when there aren't major efficiency losses to doing\n      so\n\nOur preference: C2\n\nConsiderations:\n    • We'd guess that major  funders  offer  substantially  more  (and  more\n      flexible,  i.e.,  capable  of  taking  advantage   of   more   diverse\n      opportunities) potential \"money moved\" over the next 1-10 years.\n    • On the other hand, a base of retail donors is more robust. The loss of\n      a single relationship could put a major dent in money moved from major\n      funders; this is not true of retail donors.\n    • Having a \"service for retail donors\" has advantages in  terms  of  the\n      kind of attention it can create for us and the kind of conversation it\n      can create. We value the fact that many critical,  intelligent  people\n      are highly interested in GiveWell; we feel that this can lead (and has\n      led) to both critical feedback and publicity.\n    • On the specific question of \"whom should we go to first\" for  a  given\n      opportunity: some donors may feel shortchanged if we go to them  first\n      (since they would have saved their money if  they  knew  someone  else\n      might fund the opportunity); some donors may feel shortchanged  if  we\n      go to others first (since they may feel that others are getting \"first\n      opportunity\" to fund outstanding opportunities). Because we see  major\n      funders as more  \"flexible,\"  we  feel  more  good  is  likely  to  be\n      accomplished by going to individual donors  first  when  there  aren't\n      major efficiency losses to doing so. (On the other hand, when there is\n      a major funder that is not highly aligned with us we will tend  to  go\n      to this funder first, with similar  reasoning  about  maximizing  good\n      accomplished.)\n\nPotential communication issues:\n    • We need to be clear about what commitments we do  and  don't  make  to\n      retail donors, in terms of\n         o Customer service\n         o Capacity allocated to  finding  giving  opportunities  that  fit\n           individual donors\n         o Our general philosophy of \"whom we'll go to first\"\n    • For specific giving opportunities, we should make sure to discuss what\n      to disclose about major funders' giving plans.  (Our  audience  should\n      have some sense of how much money we expect from major funders  for  a\n      given opportunity, and what size funding gap this would leave.)\n    • We may need to look into rebranding parts of  our  website/pitch  that\n      currently play up our focus on retail donors.\n\nOpportunities for more investigation:\n    • Poll retail donors on whether they'd prefer to be \"first\" or  \"second\"\n      in line to fund outstanding giving opportunities\n    • Poll retail donors on what \"customer  service\"  they'd  be  upset  vs.\n      indifferent to lose\n\n\n         What relationship should GiveWell have with Good Ventures?\n\nGiveWell and  Good  Ventures  find  themselves  substantially  in  alignment\nregarding  the  most  promising  directions  for  investigating  new  giving\nopportunities. The organizations  are  currently  capable  of  helping  each\nother in the following ways:\n    • As a major funder, Good Ventures has  provided  operating  support  to\n      GiveWell (~10% of our operating budget for 2011)  and  has  also  made\n      grants based on its recommendations.\n    • Good  Ventures  has  an  easier  time  getting  access  to  charities,\n      foundations, scholars, etc.  than  GiveWell  and  has  been  extremely\n      helpful in getting this access, which is essential to  maximizing  the\n      quality of GiveWell's research.\n    • Good Ventures has full-time staff  (possibly  only  one  staffer,  but\n      possibly more in the future) whose interests and abilities  are  well-\n      suited to helping with GiveWell's mission; due to the mission overlap,\n      Good Ventures is willing to provide some help of this nature.\n    • GiveWell has a substantially  larger  staff  and  more  organizational\n      experience than Good Ventures.  It  can  thus  potentially  help  Good\n      Ventures via\n         o Its staff's work furthering  its  own  mission,  which  overlaps\n           heavily with Good Ventures's mission\n         o Advising Good Ventures on particular  giving  opportunities  and\n           recommendations\n         o General advice on how to run an organization that is focused  on\n           transparency  and  is  sector-agnostic  in   its   approach   to\n           accomplishing good\n         o Helping with recruiting, training and managing staff\n\nSome of these items would be best facilitated by  close  coordination,  such\nas sharing office space  and  allowing  employees  of  one  organization  to\nprovide general support to the other.\n\nBelow, we list options but don't list our  preference  as  we  have  yet  to\nreach conclusions about each.\n\nOur options:\n\nQuestion  A  (overarching):  what  should  the  general  structure  of   the\nrelationship be?\n    • Option A1: merge into one organization (note that this  has  not  been\n      proposed by either party; rather, we’re attempting  to  list  all  the\n      conceivable options for the purpose of discussion.)\n    • Option A2: remain separate organizations, but establish  policies  for\n      coordinating closely together, including a  joint  recruiting/training\n      process for new hires and potential co-location\n    • Option A3: take more formal measures to publicly emphasize limitations\n      of the relationship, potentially including a cap  on  general  support\n      provided by GiveWell to Good Ventures,  a  cap  on  operating  support\n      provided by Good Ventures to GiveWell, and lack of co-location\n\nQuestion B: how should  the  two  organizations  coordinate  on  recruiting,\nhiring, training and management?\n    • Option B1: merger - employees are hired,  trained  and  managed  by  a\n      single organization\n    • Option B2: Good Ventures and GiveWell hire, train and manage  entirely\n      separately\n    • Option B3: GiveWell helps Good  Ventures  with  hiring,  training  and\n      management but considers this help to be \"general support,\" subject to\n      the \"general support\" guidelines in Appendix A.\n    • Option B4: (not mutually exclusive with Option 3)  Good  Ventures  and\n      GiveWell can \"trade\" person-hours  between  them;  these  person-hours\n      will be tracked and any imbalance will be reimbursed  at  TBD  billing\n      rates (the imbalance may be capped as well).\n\nQuestion C: should GiveWell and Good Ventures co-locate?\n\n    • Option C1: co-locate\n    • Option C2: do not co-locate\n    • Option C3: co-locate but with specific provisions  for  ensuring  that\n      each organization has ample opportunity to interact without the  other\n      present and reconsider the relationship  over  time.  For  example,  a\n      requirement that the organizations  work  separately  with  a  certain\n      frequency and revisit the relationship with a certain frequency.\n\n\nQuestion D: how much operating support would  it  be  appropriate  for  Good\nVentures to provide GiveWell?\n\n\n    • Option D1: no limit\n    • Option D2: cap the amount of operating support any particular funder\n      may provide to GiveWell, to help ensure independence\n    • Option D3: Option 2 + allow \"earned revenue\" for general support as\n      defined in Appendix A, subject to a TBD billing rate\n\nConsiderations:\n    • The two organizations are capable of providing major support  to  each\n      other  in  accomplishing  their   missions.   The   less   close   the\n      relationship, the less effectively this can be done.\n    • Recruiting/hiring/management present the biggest challenges.  The  two\n      organizations are currently looking for essentially the same  employee\n      profile and have a large degree of overlap in their missions. The most\n      purely efficient arrangement would seem to  be  \"sharing  staff,\"  and\n      this would facilitate optimal hiring (bringing on  the  right  mix  of\n      people to contribute to the shared  mission).  However,  any  sort  of\n      \"sharing staff\" raises challenges around (a) day-to-day management and\n      (b) ultimate authority over  an  employee  if  the  two  organizations\n      overlap less in the future.\n    • More minor challenges: we  would  like  to  make  it  easier  for  all\n      employees to be privy to the same confidential information and for all\n      employees  to  be  available  as  \"organization  representatives\"   in\n      meetings. We believe these can be worked around with the organizations\n      remaining separate.\n    • The closer the relationship,  the  more  challenging  it  may  be  for\n      GiveWell to retain substantive and perceived control of  its  research\n      agenda. This is important for its credibility to  retail  donors,  and\n      potentially to major funders as well\n    • A  merger  would  raise  major  challenges  in  terms  of  determining\n      authority, which could have implications for the long-term success  of\n      both organizations.\n\nPotential communication issues:\n    • We'll need to make the case publicly (and create appropriate  policies\n      to ensure) that any relationship with Good Ventures does not  stop  us\n      from\n         o Setting our research agenda based on our beliefs about the  most\n           promising avenues of exploration\n         o Making recommendations based  on  our  beliefs  about  the  best\n           giving opportunities\n         o Writing honestly about the strengths, weaknesses, successes  and\n           failures of the groups we recommend\n         o Publicly critiquing groups supported by Good Ventures, and  Good\n           Ventures itself, when warranted\n    • We'll need to clearly lay out our policies for  forming  relationships\n      with other funders, and under  what  conditions  they  would  reach  a\n      similar level to our relationship  with  Good  Ventures  (we  have  an\n      outline of this in Appendix A)\n    • We'll commit to clearly articulating what Good Ventures's role  is  in\n      each investigation/recommendation we make.\n    • The closer the  relationship,  the  more  intensified  the  challenges\n      around \"retail vs. major funders\" become.\n\nOpportunities for more investigation:\n    • Speak with an attorney to get a sense of any legal  issues  raised  by\n      close coordination/the partnership\n    • Speak with a sample of major retail donors to get their thoughts\n    • Speak with people who have for-profit  or  nonprofit  experience  with\n      mergers and partnerships to get their thoughts\n\n\n\n\n\n Overriding theme: in what ways should GiveWell resemble, and differ from, a\n                                 foundation?\n\n\n\n\nAbove, we've discussed the following questions:\n\n\n      Should GiveWell \"act more like a foundation\" in terms of the sorts  of\n      giving opportunities we'll consider?\n\n\n      Should GiveWell target \"retail donors\" or \"major funders?\"\n\n\n      What relationship should GiveWell have with Good Ventures?\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three contemplate a move in the direction of, in some sense,  coming  to\nresemble a foundation more. Our preference is to  move  in  this  direction,\nwhile still providing enough retail-donor-targeting service to keep up  with\ndemand. As we do so, we think it's worth stepping back  and  noting  how  we\nenvision the similarities and differences between  GiveWell  and  charitable\nfoundations such as the Gates Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, etc.\n\n\nGiveWell is similar to such foundations in that:\n    • We see our role as helping to allocate particular funds (our \"money\n      moved\") as effectively as possible.\n    • We don't endorse any rigid formula or procedure for determining the\n      best giving opportunities. We are open to using intuition and judgment\n      calls in deciding what to prioritize and what to recommend.\n\nGiveWell is different from such foundations in that:\n    • Our brand is built on transparency. We expect to be held accountable\n      for publishing the full details and reasoning behind our analysis.\n    • We are \"sector-agnostic\": we expect to be held accountable for\n      choosing issue areas and charities based on our judgment of how to\n      accomplish the most good, not based on personal passions or personal\n      relationships.\n    • We believe that we hold ourselves to an unusually high standard in\n      terms of being self-critical. For any given giving opportunity, we try\n      to ask (and encourage others to ask) critical questions and make\n      serious efforts to answer them. While other foundations may have the\n      same belief about their self-criticality, our transparency means we\n      can (and expect to) be held accountable for this quality.\n\nThrough these distinguishing factors, we believe we can bring a new level\nof critical inquiry and public debate to charitable giving, which in turn\nwill move toward our vision of a world in which donors reward effectiveness\nin improving lives.\n\nNext steps\n\n\nAfter we resolve the above issues, we should deal with the following:\n\n\nCommunication issues\n\n    • Write about what decisions we've made and why; solicit feedback\n    • Revisit\n         o Our mission and vision statements  (we  don't  expect  these  to\n           change)\n         o Our standard \"pitches\": pitches to major funders, pitches to the\n           media\n         o Our website, advertisements and job postings\n\n\nResearch agenda\n\n    • Lay out our current priorities and reasoning\n    • Lay out the criteria by which we decide which giving opportunities and\n      sectors to investigate vs. drop\n    • Lay out the criteria by which we decide which giving opportunities to\n      recommend for funding\n\n\nPartnerships\n\n    • Lay out criteria by which we would take on future partnerships at\n      different levels of involvement (related to the criteria by which we\n      decide which giving opportunities and sectors to investigate vs. drop)\n                                 Other notes\n\n\nTransparency\n\n    • Over the past year we've had many challenges with transparency due to\n      our higher profile and higher number of in-person conversations.\n    • Our current process for conversations is generally to\n         o Record conversations\n         o Have a staff member produce a summary of the conversations in a\n           relatively short amount of time; run it by the person we spoke\n           with and ask for any changes before we post\n         o Be up front with anyone we speak with about our plans and give\n           them the opportunity to opt-out of recording and/or having notes\n           from the conversation published\n    • Our current process for charity/giving opportunity writeups is\n      generally to\n         o Notify the organization up front that we would like to write\n           about our thinking, good or bad, but that it will have the\n           opportunity to withhold any nonpublic information if it chooses\n           to do so (and will also have the opportunity to respond with a\n           prominent public \"charity response\")\n         o Once we have reached a conclusion on an organization, offer it\n           the choice of reviewing a draft writeup or simply declining to\n           participate in our process\n         o Draft a writeup, send it to them for approval, and be fairly\n           liberal about engaging in any conversations they'd like to have,\n           considering any changes they'd like to make, etc.\n    • Our current process for blog posts is generally to\n         o Draft a post\n         o Send it to any parties that may have issues with it\n         o Be fairly liberal about engaging in any conversations they'd\n           like to have, considering any changes they'd like to make, etc.\n    • Our feeling about our current approach is that\n         o It results in a large quantity of publicly available information\n         o There are some tense moments and tense conversations, but no\n           apparent cases of outright anger or burned bridges\n         o The process is time-consuming for us and for the groups we work\n           with\n         o We feel the benefits - in terms of being able to be public about\n           our thinking and provide an example of a transparency-\n           emphasizing approach to giving - outweigh the costs\n\n Appendix A: draft guidelines for \"general support\" provided by GiveWell to\n                  other organizations with mission overlap\n\nGiveWell believes that its relationship with Good Ventures is important and\nthat Good Ventures's general mission has significant overlap with\nGiveWell's. For both of these reasons, GiveWell believes that providing\n\"general support\" to Good Ventures (i.e., helping Good Ventures with its\nown to-do list even where this list does not directly overlap with\nGiveWell's) has value for GiveWell's mission.\n\n\nFor the time being, GiveWell is willing to spend up to 20 total person-\nhours per week on general support, of which up to 10 person-hours per week\nmay be Co-Executive Director time. GiveWell will carefully track which of\nits person-hours are spent on general support to Good Ventures, and will\nrevisit this matter if it finds that the figures are consistently or\nsignificantly exceeding these targets.\n\nGiveWell anticipates that in the future, there may be more funders that it\nmakes sense to provide some general support to. GiveWell anticipates that\nit will follow similar guidelines with any such funders. The \"target person-\nhour allocations\" (the amounts we're aiming not to exceed) could change\nover time and depending on the situation, but we will make sure that our\ntargets for *total* person-hours spent on general support for other funders\nremain a reasonable proportion of our overall person-hours, leaving us\nplenty of capacity to pursue other priorities.\n\nGiveWell will work with other funders depending on:\n      • Value of the relationship - what the organization can/will do to\n        help GiveWell directly, in terms of operating support, \"money\n        moved,\" networking, etc.\n      • Independent impact of the organization receiving general support\n        - (a) how powerful/influential the organization is or will be; (b)\n        how aligned its mission is with ours.\nGeneral support vs. strategic overlap\n\nFor purposes of targeting, it's important to distinguish between spending\ntime on \"general support to Good Ventures [or other funders]\" and spending\ntime on \"strategic overlap.\" The latter refers to activities that would be\nhigh priorities for GiveWell even aside from any considerations of building\nrelationships or building general capacity for other organizations such as\nGood Ventures. \"Strategic overlap\" activities aren't subject to the targets\nabove, regardless of whether they involve assisting/working closely with\nanother organization.\n\nTo help make the distinction clear, we provide a few examples from the past\nfew months:\n     • Good Ventures is interested in evaluating a grantee. GiveWell would\n       not assign a high priority to investigating this organization in the\n       absence of Good Ventures. However, GiveWell does seek to build its\n       general understanding of policy advocacy (the field in which this\n       grantee works) and believes the best way to start doing so is to\n       recruit part-time contractors with more policy experience than\n       GiveWell's current staff and work with them to evaluate some policy\n       advocacy organization. Good Ventures's access to the grantee, and\n       its capacity for hiring and managing such contractors, are useful\n       for this purpose. GiveWell has helped Good Ventures to identify and\n       evaluate such contractors; we consider this strategic overlap.\n     • GiveWell has offered to help evaluate candidates that Good Ventures\n       has sourced as potential employees. The main purpose is to build\n       Good Ventures's general capacity. Time spent interviewing these\n       candidates is general support.\n     • GiveWell has assigned an employee to transcribe the audio of the\n       recent Board meeting, so that Good Ventures can more easily\n       determine what confidential information needs to be redacted from\n       the public version. We would do this for any Board member, in line\n       with our goal of allowing Board members to speak freely. We consider\n       this strategic overlap.\n     • The President of Good Ventures spoke at a gathering of major\n       philanthropists, and GiveWell helped prepare for this. We believe\n       that this work furthered the general goal of promoting certain core\n       values of GiveWell (impact-oriented giving; strategic cause\n       selection), but a major consideration in helping with this was to\n       increase Good Ventures's overall capacity. We consider this a\n       borderline case, but would count it as general support. \n     • GiveWell has provided some support in recommending foundations for\n       Good Ventures to engage with. It has also provided some support on\n       co-funding (by offering advice to Good Ventures on which projects\n       proposed by other foundations to participate in financially).\n       Learning more in general about major foundations, particularly\n       through co-funding, would be a very high priority for us if we had\n       the resources and access to do so, so we consider all of this work\n       strategic overlap.\n-----------------------\n[1] http://blog.givewell.org/2011/02/21/givewells-plan-for-2011-specifics-\nof-research/\n\n"

This post summarizes what changed for\nGiveWell in 2012 and what it means for the future. Future posts will\nelaborate.\nFor us, the major developments of 2012 were:\n\n• We continued to strengthen our partnership with Good Ventures. In 2011,\n  we made contact with Good Ventures, a new foundation, and they made\n  grants totaling $750,000 to our top-rated charities. During 2012, we have\n  been working more closely with Good Ventures, including playing a\n  significant role in $1.1 million worth of grants made to organizations\n  that are not top-rated GiveWell charities. Good Ventures also made $2\n  million in grants to GiveWell top charities in 2012.\n• We relocated to San Francisco. During 2012, we decided to move our office\n  (and staff) from New York to San Francisco. As of February 2013, we have\n  completed the move. We are sharing office space in San Francisco with\n  Good Ventures.\n• Growth in money moved was strong, but appears to be slowing relative to\n  the previous 100% per year pace. Our total money moved for 2012 was over\n  $8.5 million (we haven’t yet finalized the tally), compared to a bit over\n  $5 million for 2011; excluding two particularly large and\n  unrepresentative donors, it was ~$5.5 million for 2012 as compared to\n  ~$3.4 million for 2011.\n• Our staff capacity has grown slower than we had hoped. We currently have\n  a staff of five full-time employees and one part-time employee, compared\n  to five full-time employees at the end of 2011; in last year’s plan we\n  expressed a hope that we would have eight full-time employees by this\n  time.\n  We continue to believe that we have more work than staff capacity our\n  current size, and recruiting will be a major priority for 2013.\n\n• We conducted a thorough review of GiveDirectly and added it to our list\n  of top charities, in addition to conducting deeper research in a number\n  of areas of global health and nutrition that we had not previously\n  investigated in depth. We anticipate continuing to look for more top\n  charities in the global health and nutrition field in 2013, particularly\n  organizations working on interventions we have not previously\n  prioritized, but our work in 2012 has led us to suspect that room for\n  more funding will be an ongoing issue as we consider new interventions.\n• Our process for conducting research on new charities has become more\n  systematic and replicable. We now have relatively stable pattern of\n  initial phone calls and document requests to prioritize organizations,\n  followed by a “deep dive” review of highly promising organizations\n  (including a site visit), along with an intervention report and cost-\n  effectiveness analysis for the intervention a potential top charity\n  conducts. In addition, more thorough (pre-publication) internal and (post-\n  publication) external reviews of our core research products have also\n  made us more confident in our recommendations than we have been\n  previously.\n• We did not make as much progress as hoped on GiveWell Labs, our effort to\n  conduct research on other causes. Upping our staff allocation to GiveWell\n  Labs, and thus the progress we make on it, is a major priority for 2013.\nOverall, in 2012 our research and our influence both improved\nsignificantly, but we see substantial room for more improvement,\nparticularly with our work on GiveWell Labs and with the development of our\norganizational capacity. We continue to believe GiveWell has enough impact\nto justify its operating expenses, and hope to have much more impact in the\nfuture.\n\nOf course, we also made plenty of mistakes in 2012, and we’ve recently\nupdated ourshortcomings log to reflect them. Perhaps most importantly, our\nprocess for considering GiveDirectly as a potential top charity started\nlater in the year than it should have, leading us to miss our goal of\nhaving our “giving season” updates ready by November 1st; this also meant\nthat our co-founders played a larger role in investigating GiveDirectly\nthan they ideally would have (due to time sensitivity), which had negative\nconsequences for the time we were able to put into GiveWell Labs and for\nthe long-term development of our organizational capacity.\n\n\nSelf-evaluation: GiveWell as a donor resource\n\nFEBRUARY 12, 2013 \nBy Holden\n  \n \nThis is the second post (of five) that we’re planning to make focused on\nour self-evaluation and future plans.\nThis post answers a set of critical questions about the state of GiveWell\nas a donor resource. The questions are the same as last year’s.\nDoes GiveWell provide quality research that highlights truly outstanding\ncharities in the areas it has covered?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2012\nWe felt that current research was high-quality and up-to-date. However:\n\n• We felt that there were multiple areas that could offer outstanding\n  opportunities that we had not yet researched as thoroughly as we could\n  have (particularly in the areas of nutrition, vaccinations, neglected\n  tropical disease control, tuberculosis control, and research and\n  development).\n• We were not satisfied with the degree to which our research was “vetted.”\n  It still seemed to us that we could make a substantial mistake or error\n  in judgment, with too high a probability that it would remain unnoticed.\n• We worried about our total “room for money moved,” which we estimated at\n  $15-20 million in our top charities; it seemed possible to us that\n  continued rapid growth could potentially lead us to “run out” of great\n  giving opportunities.\nProgress since Feb 2012\nIn 2012, we wrote that we wanted to:\n\n 1. Revisit the goal of having our work subjected to formal, consistent,\n    credible external review.\n 2. Continue to look for more outstanding giving opportunities for\n    individual donors, particularly in the areas we have identified as most\n    promising (i.e. global health and nutrition).\n 3. Begin to look for more outstanding giving opportunities for individual\n    donors throughGiveWell Labs.\nIn 2012, we made limited progress on #1, strong progress on #2, and less\nthan anticipated progress on #3:\n\n 1. We did not solicit any new external reviews of our work in 2012, and we\n    did not formally revisit the goal of doing so. Rather than focusing on\n    increasing formal expert review over the past year, we subjected our key\n    pages to a higher level of pre-publication internal review, ensuring\n    that pages and spreadsheets that play an important role in our final\n    recommendations are thoroughly checked by at least one person who did\n    not play a role in their production. We do not view this change as\n    eliminating the eventual need for formal outside review, but we see it\n    as adequate for our current needs. We also feel that the increased level\n    of informal critical attention our research has received from the\n    outside has lowered the need for formal external review (more on this in\n    a future post).\n 2. We added GiveDirectly to our list of top-rated charities in November\n    2012, after athorough review that included a site visit and review of\n    the evidence for unconditional cash transfers. We also conducted further\n    investigations in the area of global health and nutrition:\n    • The most promising new interventions that we looked\n      into, immunizations, Vitamin A supplementation (forthcoming), and\n      salt iodization (forthcoming), do not appear to have the sort of room\n      for more funding that our top charities do (i.e., we do not see\n      opportunities to translate additional dollars directly into\n      additional people reached).\n    • We subjected our existing work on bednets and deworming to a higher\n      level of scrutiny (see Revisiting the case for insecticide-treated\n      nets, Insecticide resistance and malaria control, Revisiting the case\n      for developmental effects of deworming,New Cochrane review of the\n      Effectiveness of Deworming).\n    • We continued to analyze organizations that seemed promising at the\n      end of our 2011 round of research. We completed or updated reviews\n      for many of these, includingGiveDirectly (now a top-rated charity)\n      and VillageReach (our #1-ranked charity from 2009-2011) in addition\n      to Doctors without Borders, Deworm the World, PATH, and many others.\n      (Our “newly published materials” email list provides links to all the\n      materials we’ve recently published.)\n 3. In the realm of GiveWell Labs,\n    • We spent a substantial amount of time this year working on meta-\n      research, includingrecommending a grant to the U.S. Cochrane Center.\n    • We also worked with Good Ventures on co-funding, including advising\n      a $1 million co-funding project with the Gates Foundation.\n    • We have also done some preliminary work on a few other causes, which\n      we will be writing about in the future.\n    However, we have not been able to devote as much time to GiveWell Labs\n    as we would have liked, and progress has accordingly been slower than\n    anticipated. We have not yet identified any giving opportunities that we\n    are ready to recommend (aside from the two grants mentioned above, both\n    funded by Good Ventures).\nWhere we stand\nWe continue to feel our research has identified outstanding giving\nopportunities for individual donors, with adequate capacity (room for more\nfunding in top charities) to absorb the level of funding that we expect in\n2013, but we believe that room for improvement remains across the three\nbroad areas we identified in 2012: continuing to find ways to subject our\nresearch to scrutiny and quality control, finding more outstanding giving\nopportunities according to our traditional criteria, and broadening our\ncriteria via GiveWell Labs.\n\nOf these three, we think the most urgent need is to make more progress on\nGiveWell Labs. Progress on that front in 2012 was much slower than hoped,\ndue to a smaller allocation of staff time than intended. In order to make\nmore progress on GiveWell Labs in the future, we may need to put less time\n(in the short term) into the other two goals, while hoping eventually to\nexpand our staff capacity so that we can pursue all three effectively.\n\nWhat we can do to improve\nWe plan to prioritize work on GiveWell Labs more highly in 2013, devoting\nmore staff time to research on new causes than we did in 2012. We aren’t\nyet sure how we will be addressing the other areas of improvement discussed\nabove; it depends heavily on how much capacity we are able to devote to\nGiveWell’s traditional work while making sure that we are moving forward\nsignificantly faster on GiveWell Labs. How to allocate capacity between\nthese two arms of GiveWell is a major question for the coming year, to be\ndiscussed further in a future post.\n\nIs it practical for donors to evaluate and use GiveWell’s research in the\nareas it has covered?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2012\nLast year, we wrote:\n\n  We feel that evidence of our credibility has substantially improved and is\n  now fairly strong, and that this is part of the reason for our\n  increased money moved.\n  Aside from revisiting our approach to external evaluation, we believe the\n  main path to improvement is to continue improving our knowledge of giving\n  opportunities and the depth of our research. We also plan to increase the\n  frequency of research meetings and conference calls to help donors engage\n  with our research.\n\nProgress since Feb 2012\n• We have significantly deepened our research on the charities and\n  interventions we recommend most highly, leading us to be more confident\n  in our recommendations this year than last year. For instance, we\n  considered the evidence regarding the rate of decay of insecticide-\n  treated bednets in far more depth than we had previously; also\n  seeRevisiting the case for insecticide-treated nets, Insecticide\n  resistance and malaria control, Revisiting the case for developmental\n  effects of deworming, New Cochrane review of the Effectiveness of\n  Deworming.\n• We have held more in-person research meetings and public conference calls\n  (five, total) than in previous years.\nWhere we stand\nWe believe that our current level of conference calls and research meetings\nis adequate to allow highly engaged people who prefer not to read the full\ntext of our reviews to access and respond to our research, but we feel that\nwe generally lack mid-level content that allows people who are moderately\nengaged to understand the basics of our research and conclusions.\n\nWhat we can do to improve\nWe plan to maintain or slightly expand our set of conference calls and in-\nperson research meetings in 2013. We hope to eventually provide more mid-\nlevel content, but do not expect to prioritize doing so in 2013.\n\nHow much funding can GiveWell’s top-rated charities effectively absorb?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2012\nWe believed that AMF could absorb up to $15 million, and SCI could absorb a\nfew million dollars as well. We had not yet begun work on GiveWell Labs in\nearnest.\n\nProgress since Feb 2012\nWe have identified one additional top charity–GiveDirectly–which has\nsignificant room for more funding.\nWe recommended grants totaling $1.1 million under the rubric of GiveWell\nLabs, but we do not have a standing set of opportunities available to\nindividual donors in this category.\n\nWhere we stand\nWe continue to believe that AMF could absorb substantial funding this year,\nin the $15-20 million range, and also believe that GiveDirectly and SCI\ncould absorb several million dollars.\n\nPartially because we have had another a year of growth and now have a\nbetter sense of what growth to expect in our “money moved” figures, we\nbelieve that “room for more funding” in our current top charities is more\nthan adequate for 2013.\n\nOur progress on GiveWell Labs has been slower than expected to date, and we\nbelieve it could be a substantial amount of time before we will have\nsubstantial “room for more money moved” in this area.\n\nWhat we can do to improve\nWe intend to continue to look for more outstanding giving opportunities.\nThis need is driven by the potential to find opportunities that may be\nbetter than our current offerings, rather than a fear that our current\nofferings will be exhausted in the short term. Currently, we see the\npromising avenues to finding these opportunities as:\n\n• Deeply investigating the areas we have identified as most promising\n  (largely within global health and nutrition).\n• Moving forward on GiveWell Labs.\nBroadly, this is a continuation of our strategy from 2012, though we expect\nto place more emphasis on the GiveWell Labs prong in 2013 than we did in\n2012.\n\n\nSelf-evaluation: GiveWell as a project\n\nFEBRUARY 15, 2013 \nBy Holden\n  \n \nThis is the third post (of five) we’re planning to make focused on our self-\nevaluation and future plans.\nThis post answers a set of critical questions for GiveWell stakeholders.\nThe questions are the same as last year’s.\nIs GiveWell’s research process “robust,” i.e., can it be continued and\nmaintained without relying on the co-Founders?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2012\nWe wrote:\n\n  We currently have 3 full-time analysts, and have made an offer to an\n  analyst who will start in July, which would bring GiveWell to 4 full-time\n  analysts. We continue to focus on recruiting and hope to reach 6 full-time\n  analysts (8 total employees) summer 2012.\n\n  Analysts take the lead on most charity investigations; co-founders may\n  provide basic guidance and sign off on work before it is\n  published. GiveWell Labs, because of its experimental nature, will be led\n  for the time being by co-founders.\nProgress since Feb 2012\nFollowing February 2012, we made two full-time hires and one part-time\nhire; one of the full-time hires departed GiveWell the same year. We also\nsaw the departure of another analyst who had started in January of 2012\n(and was included in the above quote). On net, therefore, the size of our\nstaff rose by one part-timer. We also employed a summer intern and a trial\nhire, both of whom may become full-time employees this year.\n\nDue to time sensitivity, the review of GiveDirectly – our new recommended\ncharity in 2012 – was led by co-founders, rather than analysts. (See\nour shortcoming on this matter.) In addition, much of the work we put into\ndeepening our research was led by co-founders. Analysts played valuable\nroles, and made far greater contributions than in previous years, but the\nshare of work done by co-founders was higher than it would have been if we\nhad not been dealing with this time sensitivity.\nTwo positive developments on this front in 2012:\n\n• Our capacity has improved significantly because of the maturation of\n  existing employees. We now have several analysts who are able to add\n  substantial value on a regular basis, improving our capacity. Alexander\n  Berger has been promoted to Senior Research Analyst and represents an\n  expansion in our capacity for top-level investigations. Natalie Crispin\n  has taken over primary management of GiveWell’s financials and donation\n  processing (which was previously handled by co-founders) and is now\n  Research Analyst and Financial Manager.\n• Our research process has become better systemized. 2012 was the first\n  year in which our process for investigating a top charity remained\n  substantially the same as in the previous year, and we feel that this\n  bodes well for our ability to train analysts to take on more of this\n  process in the future.\nOur work on GiveWell Labs is still new and exploratory, and thus is led by\nsenior staff.\nWhere we stand\nWe currently have three full-time and one part-time analyst, along with the\ntwo co-founders. We are currently re-thinking our hiring process and the\nroles and qualifications of people we wish to hire.\nAlthough analysts have taken on more responsibility, we remain reliant on\nGiveWell’s co-founders for significant core research work. Elie Hassenfeld\nis heavily involved in managing and conducting individual charity/giving\nopportunity investigations and Holden Karnofsky is heavily involved in\ncompleting literature reviews for the evidence of effectiveness and cost-\neffectiveness analyses for interventions.\n\nWhat we can do to improve\nWe intend to make hiring a priority over the coming year, but are not yet\nsure of exactly what path this will take. We have some ideas for finding\nnew hires more effectively than previously, including (a) evaluating people\nvia trial work rather than relying on interviews when possible; (b)\nconsidering more senior hires with experience that is directly relevant to\nthe work our research analysts do. We don’t believe we have yet found a\nreliable formula for hiring people, though we believe we are improving on\nthis dimension, both through trial and error in hiring and through getting\na better sense over time (via repetition) of what work our employees need\nto do.\n\nDoes GiveWell present its research in a way that is likely to be persuasive\nand impactful (i.e., is GiveWell succeeding at “packaging” its research)?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2012\nWe wrote:\n\n  As traffic to our website has increased over the past 12 months, we would\n  guess that the importance of better packaging our research has risen. In\n  particular, we feel our site is poorly suited to donors who want to spend\n  more than a few minutes but less than an hour on our site. (We have\n  designed the site to make quick action easy and to provide significant\n  depth, but we have no “middle level” of depth for gaining some information\n  relatively quickly.)\n\nProgress since Feb 2012\nNone. This has continued to be a low priority over the past year.\n\nWhere we stand\nWe continue to believe that the lack of mid-level content is a shortcoming\nthat likely prevents us from reaching some potential donors.\n\nWhat we can do to improve\nWe have several ideas that we could execute in order to produce more “mid-\nlevel” content regarding our recommendations, but we do not plan to\nprioritize this work in the coming year.\n\nDoes GiveWell reach a lot of potential customers (i.e., is GiveWell\nsucceeding at “marketing” its research)?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2012\nWe wrote:\n\n  As detailed previously, our growth remains robust:\n  • We tracked over $5 million to our recommended charities in 2011\n    compared to approximately $1.5 million in 2010.\n  • The number of donors who gave to our recommended charities grew by\n    about 3x in 2011 compared to 2010.\n  • Our website traffic roughly doubled in 2011 compared to 2010.\n  As long as we continue to grow at ~2-3x (which continued thus far in\n  2012), we will consider our growth to be strong, and will not consider\n  outreach to be an urgent priority.\n\nProgress since Feb 2012; where we stand\nAlthough growth in 2012 continued to be strong, it has decelerated relative\nto the 2-3x per year growth we experienced through 2011. Our total money\nmoved for 2012 was estimated to be over $9 million (we haven’t yet\nfinalized the tally), compared to a bit over $5 million for 2011; excluding\ntwo particularly large and unrepresentative donors, it was $5.5-6 million\nfor 2012 as compared to ~$3.4 million for 2011 and ~$1.4 million for 2010.\n(Details on metrics are forthcoming.)\n\nIn addition, we believe the following developments may have long-term\nsignificance for our ability to increase our money moved:\n\n• The evolution of our relationship with Good Ventures and work on GiveWell\n  Labs, both of which we hope will allow us to have more influence on\n  donors giving $1+ million per year over the long run.\n• Our relocation to San Francisco, now completed. This relocation\n   • Allows us to work more closely with Good Ventures.\n   • Allows us to investigate the hypothesis that we can reach more major\n     donors in San Francisco than we could in New York. Several of our\n     supporters have advanced this hypothesis, and there are a few reasons\n     to believe it might be true: (a) Silicon Valley may have more major\n     donors who are still relatively uncommitted (whereas many of the major\n     donors we’ve met in New York City often sit on multiple boards and have\n     largely already determined their charitable priorities); (b) it may be\n     easier to network in Silicon Valley (we’ve observed that our most\n     prominent connections in the finance industry have very limited\n     connections to other major donors, whereas our most prominent\n     connections in Silicon Valley have many connections to other major\n     donors); (c) the culture of Silicon Valley may be more amenable to\n     certain of our key values (particularly transparency, innovation and\n     rational altruism). That said, there are conceptual arguments going\n     both ways. What seems most relevant to us, from the perspective of\n     deciding where we should be based, is that (a) GiveWell’s network in\n     San Francisco already appears to be about as strong as our East Coast\n     network, despite the fact that we’ve been based on the East Coast since\n     the inception of our project; (b) the benefits to GiveWell if this\n     hypothesis turns out to be correct (i.e., if we end up appealing to\n     many major donors on the West Coast that we couldn’t have connected\n     with from the East Coast) are much larger than the costs if it is\n     incorrect (since we have a solid understanding of our East Coast\n     network and its potential and don’t feel GiveWell is giving up much by\n     moving, as long as we continue to spend some time on the East Coast\n     maintaining relationships).\nWhat we can do to improve\nWe believe that we could improve growth in money moved by improving the\n“packaging” of our research – not only by providing a middle level of\ndetail but also by generally working harder to make an emotionally\ncompelling case for our top charities. However, we do not plan to\nprioritize this work in the coming year.\n\nWe intend to raise the priority of GiveWell Labs, which (as discussed\nabove) will hopefully broaden the donor base we are able to reach and\nresult in significantly more money moved.\nIs GiveWell a healthy organization with an active Board, staff in\nappropriate roles, appropriate policies and procedures, etc.?\nWhere we stood as of Feb 2012\nWe wrote:\n\n  We were happy with our board and policies…. We project revenues that will\n  meet expenses for 2012 and currently have what we consider a safe level of\n  cash reserves. We project a deficit for 2013 but expect to be able to fund\n  the gap using the strategies laid out above.\n\nProgress since Feb 2012\nWe are still finalizing our 2012 financials, but preliminarily, we believe\nthe 2012 revenues exceeded expenses. We made some modifications to our\nBoard of Directors. We added GiveWell co-founder Elie Hassenfeld; we also\nadded a Board member in 2012 who has departed in early 2013, and added\nanother Board member in early 2013.\nWhere we stand\nWe are still finalizing our 2012 financials, but preliminarily, we project\na deficit for 2013 according to our most aggressive hiring projections. If\nwe do hire as planned we may increase the priority of fundraising, but\ncurrently, given our level of cash reserves and continued growth in\nrevenue, we are happy with where we stand in this area.\n\nWhat we can do to improve\nWe intend to continue taking opportunities to raise funds for GiveWell\noperations when the opportunities present themselves, but do not intend to\nmake fundraising for GiveWell one of our primary priorities (or uses of\ntime) for 2013. The same broadly applies to recruiting new Board members\n(we intend to take available opportunities but do not plan on spending\nsignificant amounts of time on active outreach for this purpose).\n\nWhat is GiveWell’s overall impact, particularly in terms of donations\ninfluenced? Does it justify the expense of running GiveWell?\nIn 2011, we had money moved of over $5 million with expenses of $356,000, a\nratio of 14:1. $1.75 million of the $5 million came from grants from Good\nVentures and pre-commitments to GiveWell Labs; the remaining $3.25 million\nwould produce an approximately 9:1 ratio.\nWe are still finalizing the figures for 2012, but we estimate that our\ntotal money moved was over $9 million with expenses of ~$700,000 (the\nlatter includes $150,000 that we’re counting as in-kind donations and\nexpenses from the Google Grants free advertising program, even though no\nmoney entered or exited our bank account for these “expenses”), a ratio of\n~13:1. Excluding two particularly large and unrepresentative donors, the\nremaining ~$5.5 million would produce an approximately 8:1 ratio.\nWe continue to believe that the “money moved” by GiveWell is more than\nenough to justify our operating expenses.\n\n\nGiveWell’s plan for 2013: a top-level decision\n\nFEBRUARY 21, 2013 \nBy Holden\n  \n \nThis is the fourth post (of five) we’re planning to make focused on our\nself-evaluation and future plans. The final post will be our metrics\nreport.\nOne of the major questions we grappled with in 2012 – and probably the\nsingle biggest open question at this moment – is how to prioritize\nresearching charities that meet ourtraditional criteria vs. broadening our\nresearch to include new causes (the work we’ve previously referred to\nas GiveWell Labs).\nWe discussed this tradeoff previously, saying that we would put enough work\ninto our traditional research to “meet demand” and would otherwise be\nprioritizing research-broadening work. We believe this approach did not\nwork well and needs to be changed, because\n• “Meeting demand” for charities that meet our traditional criteria\n  arguably includes not just identifying top charities, but investigating\n  them deeply. Over the course of 2012, we spent significant time deepening\n  our understanding of our top charities and their interventions\n  (see Revisiting the case for insecticide-treated nets, Insecticide\n  resistance and malaria control, Revisiting the case for developmental\n  effects of deworming, New Cochrane review of the Effectiveness of\n  Deworming). This work ended up taking significant co-founder time, and\n  conceptually we believe that there is no limit to how deeply we can\n  investigate our top charities. (This isn’t to say that we know such depth\n  is what our audience requires; this is one of the things we’re hoping to\n  learn more about, as discussed below.)\n• As discussed previously, we made much less progress on cause-broadening\n  work than we had hoped to, largely because of the above point.\n• We believe that continuing to improve our offerings under our traditional\n  criteria is not the most efficient way to find the best possible giving\n  opportunities. However, we also believe (though, again, we could be wrong\n  and are hoping to learn more) that a sizable part of our audience values\n  our traditional-criteria charities and does not value our cause-\n  broadening work.\nWe now see the situation as potentially involving two different audiences\nfor GiveWell’s work, with different values and priorities; rather than\nclaiming we can fully serve both (we’re too resource-constrained to do so),\nwe need to explicitly define and segment the audiences, determine how to\nassign resources to each, and do the best we can for each within the\nresource constraints we set.\n\nThe next step for us is to get better data on the extent to which, and way\nin which, our audience is divided. We need to know which of our followers\nare most interested in our cause-broadening work as opposed to our\ntraditional criteria, and what aspects of each are most important to them.\n\nAccordingly, we have created a survey for GiveWell followers, seeking to\ngauge the appeal of different possible paths we could take to different\nparts of our audience. We are using the survey as only one factor to\ndetermine how to move forward, but we would very much appreciate\nparticipation from any followers.\nFollowing our collection and analysis of survey results, we will publish\nfurther content regarding how we plan to segment our work and what we\nbelieve we will be able to deliver. Further discussion of our 2013 plans is\nnot forthcoming until after that point.\n\n(Note that our most recent Board meeting focuses on the issues discussed\nhere, for those who are interested in listening.)\n                   Take the survey for GiveWell followers\n\nUpdate on GiveWell’s Plans for 2013\n\nMARCH 14, 2013 \nBy Holden\n  \n \nPreviously, we wrote about the need to trade off time spent on (a) our\ncharities that meet ourtraditional criteria vs. (b) broadening our research\nto include new causes (the work we’ve been referring to as GiveWell Labs).\nThis post goes into more detail on the considerations in favor of assigning\nresources to each, and lays out our working plan for 2013.\n   Key considerations in allocating resources to traditional criteria vs.\n                                GiveWell Labs\nWe see major advantages to upping our allocation to GiveWell Labs:\n\n• Most importantly, we would guess that the best giving opportunities are\n  likely to lie outside of our traditional work, and our mission and\n  passion is to find the best giving opportunities we can.\n  Our traditional criteria apply only to a very small subset of possible\n  giving opportunities, and it’s a subset that doesn’t seem uniquely\n  difficult to find funders for. (While there are certainly causes that are\n  easier to raise money for than global health, it’s also the case that\n  governments and large multilateral donors such as GFATM put large amounts\n  of money into the interventions we consider most proven and cost-\n  effective, including vaccines – hence our inability to find un-funded\n  opportunities in this space – as well asbednets, cash\n  transfers and deworming.) While we do believe that being able to measure\n  something is a major plus holding all else equal – and that it’s\n  particularly important forcasual donors – we no longer consider ourselves\n  to be “casual,” and we would guess that opening ourselves up to the full\n  set of things a funder can do will eventually lead to substantially\n  better giving opportunities than the ones we’ve considered so far.\n• We believe that we are hitting diminishing returns on our traditional\n  research. We have been fairly thorough in identifying the most evidence-\n  supported interventions and looking for the groups working on them, and\n  we believe it’s unlikely that there are other existing charities that fit\n  our criteria as well as or better than our current top charities.\n  We have previously alluded to such diminishing returns and now feel more\n  strongly about them. We put a great deal of work into our traditional\n  research in 2012, both on finding more charities working on proven cost-\n  effective interventions (nutrition interventions andimmunizations) and on\n  more deeply understanding our existing top charities (seeRevisiting the\n  case for insecticide-treated nets, Insecticide resistance and malaria\n  control, Revisiting the case for developmental effects of deworming, New\n  Cochrane review of the Effectiveness of Deworming). Yet none of this work\n  changed anything about our bottom-line recommendations; the only change\n  to our top charities came because of the emergence/maturation of a new\n  group (GiveDirectly).\n  Putting in so much work without coming to new recommendations (or even\n  finding a promising path to doing so) provides, in our view, a strong\n  sign that we have not been using our resources as efficiently as possible\n  for the goal of finding the best giving opportunities possible. We\n  believe that substantially broadening our scope is the change most likely\n  to improve the situation.\n\n• GiveWell Labs also has advantages from a marketing perspective –\n  improving our chances of attracting major donors – as\n  discussed previously.\nWe also see major considerations in favor of maintaining a high level of\nquality for our more traditional work:\n\n• GiveWell Labs is still experimental, and we haven’t established that this\n  work can identify outstanding giving opportunities or that there would be\n  broad demand for the recommendations derived from such work. By contrast,\n  we have strong reason to believe that we do our traditional work well and\n  that there is broad and growing demand for it.\n• When giving season arrives this year, many donors (including us) will\n  want concrete recommendations for where to give. At this point, the best\n  giving opportunities we know of are the ones identified by our\n  traditional process, and continuing to follow this process is the best\n  way we know of to find outstanding giving opportunities within a year\n  (though we believe that GiveWell Labs is likely to generate better giving\n  opportunities over a longer time horizon).\n• The survey we recently conducted has lowered the weight that we place on\n  a third potential consideration. We previously believed that “a sizable\n  part of our audience values our traditional-criteria charities and does\n  not value our cause-broadening work.”\n  However, in going through our survey responses, we found that over 95% of\n  respondents were interested in or open to (i.e., marked “1″ or “2″ for)\n  at least one category of research that falls clearly outside our\n  traditional work (we consider the first two categories on the survey to\n  fall within our traditional “proven cost-effective” framework).\n  Furthermore, over 90% of respondents were interested in or open to at\n  least one category of research that would not be directly connected to\n  evidence-backed interventions at all (i.e., would involve neither funding\n  evidence-backed interventions nor funding the creation of better\n  evidence). Even when looking at the four areas that we believe to be most\n  controversial (the three political-advocacy-related areas and the “global\n  catastrophic risks” area), ~70% of respondents expressed interest in or\n  openness to these categories. These figures were broadly the same whether\n  considering the entire set of survey respondents or subsets such as\n  “donors” and “major donors.”\n  More information on the survey is available at the end of this post.\n\n                          Our working plan for 2013\nThe items that we consider essential for our “traditional” work are:\n\n• Continuing to do charity updates (example) on our existing top charities.\n• Reviewing any charity we come across that looks like it has a substantial\n  chance of meeting our traditional criteria as well as, or better than,\n  our current #1 charity (which would require not only that the charity\n  itself has outstanding transparency, but also that the intervention it\n  works on has an outstanding academic evidence base). We have created\n  an application page for charities that believe they can meet these\n  criteria.\n• Hiring. As mentioned previously, we believe our process has reached a\n  point where we ought to be able to hire, train and manage people to carry\n  it out with substantially reduced involvement from senior staff. We are\n  currently hiring for the Research Associate role, and if we could find\n  strong Research Associates we would be able to be more thorough in our\n  traditional work at little cost to GiveWell Labs.\nWe plan to execute on all three of these items. We do not plan, in 2013, to\nprioritize (a) looking more deeply into the academic case for our top\ncharities’ interventions; (b) searching for, and investigating, charities\nthat are likely to be outstanding giving opportunities but less outstanding\nthan our current #1 charity; (c) investigating new ways of delivering\nproven cost-effective interventions, such as partnering with large\norganizations via restricted funding; (d) reviewing academic evidence for\npossibly proven cost-effective interventions that we have not found\noutstanding charities working on. All four of these items may become\npriorities again in the future, depending largely on our staff capacity.\n\nBetween the above priorities and other aspects of running our organization\n(administration, processing and tracking donations, outreach, etc.) we have\nsignificant work to do that doesn’t fall under the heading of GiveWell Labs\nresearch. However, we expect to be able to raise our allocation to GiveWell\nLabs, to the point where our staff overall puts more total research time\ninto GiveWell Labs than into our traditional work.\n\nFor similar reasons to those we laid out last year, we continue to\nprioritize expanding and maintaining our research above other priorities.\nWe do not expect to put significant time into research vetting (see this\nrecent post on the subject) or exploring new possibilities for outreach\n(though we will continue practices such as our conference calls and\nresearch meetings). We are continuing to see strong growth in money\nmoved without prioritizing these items.\nSurvey details:\nWe publicly published our feedback survey and linked to it in a blog\npost and an email to ouremail list. We also emailed most people we had on\nrecord as having given $10,000 or more in a given year to our top\ncharities, specifically asking them to complete the survey, if they hadn’t\ndone so.\nIn analyzing the data, we looked at the results for all submissions (minus\nthe ones we had identified as spam or solicitations); for people who had\nput their name and reported giving to our top charities in the past; for\npeople who reported giving $10k+ to our top charities in the past,\nregardless of whether they put our name; and for people who we could verify\n(using their names) as past $10k+ donors. The results were broadly similar\nwith each of these approaches.\n\nWe do not have permission to share individual entries, but for questions\nasking the user to provide a 1-5 ranking (which comprised the bulk of the\nsurvey), we provide the number of responses for each ranking, for each of\nthe four categories discussed in the previous paragraph. These are\navailable at our public survey data spreadsheet.\n\n\nGiveWell annual review for 2012: details on GiveWell’s money moved and web\ntraffic\n\nMARCH 12, 2013 \nBy Natalie\n  \n \nThis is the final post (of five) we have made focused on our self-\nevaluation and future plans.\nThis post lays out highlights from our metrics report for 2012. For more\ndetail, see our full metrics report (PDF).\n1. In 2012, GiveWell tracked $9.57 million in money moved based on our\nrecommendations, a significant increase over past years.\n[pic]\n\n2. Our #1 charity received about 60% of the money moved and our #2 and #3\ncharities each received over $1 million as a result of our\nrecommendation. Organizations that we designated “standouts” until November\n(when we decided not to use this designation anymore) received fairly small\namounts. $1.1 million went to “learning grants” (details hereand here) that\nGiveWell recommended to Good Ventures.\n                                    [pic]\n3. Growth was robust for every donor size. As in 2011, a majority of growth\nin overall money moved came from donors giving $10,000 or more.\n                                    [pic]\nThis table excludes Good Ventures and donations for which we don’t have\nindividual information. More in our full metrics report.\n4. Web traffic continued to grow. A major driver of this growth was Google\nAdWords, which we received for free from Google as part of the Google\nGrants program. As in prior years, search traffic (both organic and\nAdWords) provided the majority of the traffic to the website. Traffic tends\nto peak in December of each year, circled in the chart below.\n[pic]\n\n                                    [pic]\n5. The group of donors giving $10,000 or more has grown from 55 to 96, but\nthe characteristics of this group have changed little. Most of these donors\nare young (for major donors) and work in finance or technology. Of the $3.2\nmillion donated by major donors who responded to our survey, $1.9 million\n(60%) came from donors under the age of 40. The most common ways they find\nGiveWell are through online searches and referral links and through Peter\nSinger.\n                                    [pic]\n                                    [pic]\n                                    [pic]\n6. As in 2011, the most common response when we asked donors giving $10,000\nor more ‘how has GiveWell changed your giving?’ was ‘I would have given a\nsimilar amount to another international charity.’\nWhat effect has GiveWell had on your giving?\n                                    [pic]\nFor donors who responded that GiveWell caused them to reallocate their\ngiving, where would you have given in GiveWell’s absence?\n                                    [pic]\n7. GiveWell’s website now processes more than twice as much giving as\nGuideStar’s and about 80% as much as Charity Navigator’s, though it offers\nfar fewer charities as options. This comparison provides evidence that the\ngrowth we saw in 2012 is due not to generalized increases in online giving\nor use of charity evaluators, but rather to GiveWell-specific factors.\n(Note that the GiveWell figure in this chart includes only what was\nprocessed through our website – not all money moved – in order to provide a\nvalid comparison to the others, for which we only have online-giving data.)\n[pic]\n\n\n"

See Attachment A.\n\n\n   Staff asserts that\n • We made substantial progress, including identifying a new top charity\n   (GiveDirectly), conducting deeper investigations of our existing top\n   charities, strengthening our partnership with Good Ventures, and\n   relocating to San Francisco.\n • Our 2012 \"money moved\" was about $9.57 million (as compared to ~$5\n   million for 2011), well in excess of our target of 9x our operating\n   expenses.\n • Our staff capacity has grown slower than hoped, and we spent less time on\n   GiveWell Labs than hoped. Growing our staff capacity and making progress\n   on GiveWell Labs are our two major priorities for 2013.\n • Other key priorities include (a) regular updates on our current top\n   charities; (b) investigations of any new potential top charities that\n   come to our attention; (c) raising any funding needed to finance the\n   expansion of our team; (d) continuing general outreach efforts.\n\n\n   4. Compensation review.  30 minutes.

Total \"money moved\"\n   (including these grants but not including operating expenses) was ~$9.6\n   million.

          "text": "\n             Financial update and fundraising plan – August 2013\n\nSummary\n\n    • We propose a fundraising policy  that  separates  “operating  expenses\n      based on individual donors” and “operating  expenses  based  on  major\n      donors,” and in both cases considers an appropriate level of operating\n      expenses to be up to 15% of projected money moved.\n    • In light of recent and projected hiring, we have a substantial deficit\n      for the coming 12 months: ~$1.1 million in (conservatively)  projected\n      expenses, ~$650,000 in projected revenues.\n    • We plan to create a series of blog posts explaining these  points  and\n      then to fundraise for our operating expenses. While  we  will  discuss\n      our fundraising needs on the blog and  in  conversations  with  donors\n      that we have appropriate relationships with,  our  primary  “ask”  for\n      first-time donors and the emphasis of our website will remain  focused\n      on giving  to  our  top  charities  rather  than  supporting  GiveWell\n      directly.\n    • We are also working on better analysis of what the trajectory of staff\n      compensation should look like, and will be presenting this at a future\n      meeting.\n\nOur general fundraising policy and philosophy\n\nWe’ve created a draft fundraising policy (Attachment B). It states that\n\n • We believe it is appropriate for our operating expenses to  equal  up  to\n   15% of our projected “money moved.” (The policy document provides support\n   for this figure.)\n • We will first attempt to raise enough funds – primarily  from  individual\n   donors, though partly from major donors and institutions – to support the\n   lesser of (our desired level of operating expenses) and (15% of projected\n   “money moved” from individual donors).\n • We will then determine whether a higher level of  operating  expenses  is\n   called for in  light  of  GiveWell’s  additional  projected  impact  from\n   influencing major donors (donors giving more than $250,000 per year).  If\n   so, we will attempt to raise any gap between the amount raised in #2  and\n   the amount needed from the major donors that GiveWell serves.\n • We may also raise money from major donors for particular expenses that we\n   would be likely to incur differently (or not incur)  in  the  absence  of\n   such donors. Examples include contractor expenses and shared office space\n   (in both cases, we would not budget as much for these items  if  we  were\n   serving only individual donors).\n • While  we  will  discuss  our  fundraising  needs  on  the  blog  and  in\n   conversations with donors that we have  appropriate  relationships  with,\n   our primary “ask” for first-time donors and the emphasis of  our  website\n   will remain focused on giving to our top charities rather than supporting\n   GiveWell directly.\n\n\nShort-term budget changes and funding needs\n\nSince our last budget update, we have:\n    • Converted one trial hire to a full-time hire.\n    • Added another trial hire who is currently active.\n    • Made arrangements for another (future) trial hire with someone who\n      previously declined a full-time offer from GiveWell in 2011.\n    • Increased the priority of recruiting in light of the fact that (a) we\n      perceive a great deal of need for more capacity at both the junior and\n      senior level; (b) we feel our recruiting and evaluation process has\n      improved significantly via an increased emphasis on referrals for\n      recruiting and trial hires for evaluation.\n\nAccordingly, our projected expenses have increased, and we now project\nexpenses of ~$1.1 million over the next 12 months, against ~$650,000 in\nprojected revenues.\n\nThis is a conservative expense projection, based on the assumption that we\nhire 1 more senior and 2 more junior staff starting in January 2014, in\naddition to converting all trial hires discussed above into full-time hires\nand maintaining one “ongoing trial hire” slot. However, the expense\nprojection also excludes rent and research contractors, both of which are\nbeing paid for via in-kind donations or earmarked funding from Good\nVentures, consistent with the policy discussed in the previous section.\n|                     |          |Aug-Oct    |Nov       |Feb-Apr   |May-Jul   |\n|                     |          |2013       |2013-Jan  |2014      |2014      |\n|                     |          |           |2014      |          |          |\n|Payroll: other       |8 analysts|$146,222.71|$169,280.8|$215,396.9|$223,919.2|\n|                     |on 8/1/13;|           |0         |7         |6         |\n|                     |4 more    |           |          |          |          |\n|                     |hires (2  |           |          |          |          |\n|                     |senior)   |           |          |          |          |\n|                     |starting  |           |          |          |          |\n|                     |January   |           |          |          |          |\n|                     |2014; plus|           |          |          |          |\n|                     |trial hire|           |          |          |          |\n|                     |slot      |           |          |          |          |\n\nOur plans regarding fundraising\n\nThe current projected expenses, ~$1.1 million, are both substantially\nlarger than projected revenue and smaller than our benchmark of 15% of\nprojected money moved from individual donors (we project ~$9 million of\nmoney moved, implying appropriate operating expenses of up to ~$1.35\nmillion).\n\nWe plan to\n    • Create a series of blog posts explaining the points in this document.\n    • Go to major “customer-donors” with these blog posts in hand and\n      solicit direct donations.\n\n"

Identify an appropriate level of operating expenses, as a function  of\n      projected “money moved” from retail donors. In this  context,  “retail\n      donors” means donors giving $250,000 or less per year.  “Money  moved”\n      is   GiveWell’s   proximate   metric   for   its   own   impact   (see\n      http://www.givewell.org/about/impact).\n   2. Attempt to raise enough funds  to  support  this  level  of  operating\n      expenses, primarily from the sorts  of  retail  donors  that  GiveWell\n      serves, though institutions seeking to support GiveWell’s work serving\n      these donors may contribute as well.\n   3. Determine whether a higher level of operating expenses is  called  for\n      in light of GiveWell’s additional projected  impact  from  influencing\n      major donors (donors giving $250,000 or more per year).\n   4. If so, raise any gap between the amount raised in #2  and  the  amount\n      needed from the major donors that GiveWell serves.\n   5. We may also raise money from major donors for particular expenses that\n      we would be likely to incur differently (or not incur) in the  absence\n      of such donors. Examples include contractor expenses and shared office\n      space (in both cases, we would not budget as much for these  items  if\n      we were serving only individual donors).\n\nWhat is an appropriate level of operating expenses as a function  of  “money\nmoved?”\n\nGiveWell has concluded  that  it  is  appropriate  to  spend  an  amount  on\noperating expenses equal to up to 15% of projected “money moved,”  based  on\nthe following observations:\n\n   1. Most  importantly,  this  figure  appears  in  line  with  what  major\n      foundations spend on operating expenses,  as  a  percentage  of  their\n      annual grants. We have assembled the relevant  data  for  the  top  10\n      private foundations in the U.S.,  and  looked  for  similar  data  for\n      foundations whose grantmaking is in  the  range  of  our  2012  “money\n      moved” from individual donors (~$6-7 million), though we’ve only found\n      it for one foundation  in  the  latter  category.  5  of  the  top  10\n      foundations (as well as the  foundation  in  the  2nd  category)  have\n      operating expenses equal to at least 15% of their annual  grantmaking.\n      The median figure is 13.67%, and the mean is 13.88%.\n   2. This figure also appears to be in a reasonable range when  considering\n      more vaguely analogous standard fees from  other  industries  (all  of\n      these figures are taken either from background knowledge or from quick\n      Googling; we haven’t attempted high precision  or  robustness  because\n      we’re just giving a general sense of the range):\n        a. “Normal” hedge fund fees tend to be around 2% of assets  managed\n           plus 20% of realized returns. For a 10% return, these would come\n           out to 4% of assets managed;  a  foundation  that  spent  4%  of\n           assets on operating expenses, while granting out 5-10% of assets\n           , would have an operating-expense-to-grants ratio of 40-80%.\n        b. Real estate broker fees tend to range  from  4-7%  of  the  sale\n           price.[1]\n        c. Contingency recruiters  tend  to  charge  20-25%  of  first-year\n           compensation for a placement.[2]\n        d.  Talent  agents  tend  to  charge  10%  of  the  payments   they\n           negotiate.[3]\n\nWe believe that one could argue for a higher figure than 15% if  there  were\na compelling case that more were  needed  to  do  a  good  job  serving  our\naudience of individual donors. However, we don’t anticipate this  being  the\ncase in the near future.\n-----------------------\n[1] http://www.realtor.com/home-finance/homebuyer-information/about-real-\nestate-agents-fee-for-service.aspx\n[2] http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/advice/20040525a1.asp\n[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent\n\n"

          "text": "Attachment C \nExecutive compensation review \n  \nWe found limited data on appropriate comparables for GiveWell staff. We focus below on (a) \neconomics professors at the University of California at Berkeley who are similar in age to Holden \nand Elie and (b) senior staff at young non­profits that were founded by \"social entrepreneurs.\" \n  \nProfessor at the University of California at Berkeley \n  \nWe think that professors at UC­Berkeley make for good comparisons because Berkeley is a \nwell­regarded school (and therefore ought to give some indication of what sort of pay attracts \ntop­tier intellectuals in a not­for­profit environment), is public (so salary information is publicly \navailable), and is located in the Bay Area. \n  \nWe believe that economics professors make the most appropriate comparison for Holden and \nElie. \n  \nWe found three professors who had received their BAs during or after 2003 (the year Holden \ngraduated from college). The total compensation for these professors was $119K (BA in 2008), \n121K (BA in 2005), and $174K (BA in 2004). Note that professors typically have ~3 months per \nyear, and ~1 day per week during the remaining months, for pursuing side engagements, \nincluding paid ones. Holden and Elie work full­time at GiveWell. \n  \nSenior staff at young non­profits \n  \nIn late 2013, we reviewed the compensation of key staff (i.e., Chief Executives and other staff \nlisted on form 990s) at other mid­stage “social entrepreneur”­led organizations including Center \nfor Effective Philanthropy, Benetech, Kiva, Root Capital, Water for People and VisionSpring. \n  \nThe comparability of these organizations is a substantial judgment call. The median budget size \nfor the organizations we looked at was $10.1 million (25th percentile: $7.3 million, 75th percentile: \n$13 million). This is substantially larger than GiveWell's operating budget, though consistent with \na budget that includes our money moved. \n  \nThe median total compensation for this group is $144,000 (25th/75th percentile of \n$118,000/167,000). Adjusted for the cost­of­living in San Francisco, it is $170,000 \n($123,000/$199,000). \n \nCompensation proposal \n \nHolden and Elie propose a salary raise from $110,000 to $130,000. In addition to salary, \nGiveWell covers health benefits for employees and their families. This is an additional \n\n$5,000­$15,000/year. "

          "text": "Sundry items for The Clear Fund aka GiveWell (August 18, 2014 Board meeting)   I. Proposed amendment to bylaws  Amendment 6 - Authority to sign checks and notes  Amendment 1 is amended to read as follows. (Changes from the original text are underlined.)  The Executive Director shall be authorized to sign checks, drafts, promissory notes, orders for the payment of money, and other evidence of indebtedness of the corporation, provided that the amount signed for does not exceed $25,000 for any given signing.   All expenses of the Clear Fund must be approved by the Board of Directors either in advance or after they are incurred. The Executive Director shall be accountable for all expenses incurred, and must submit all such expenses for Board approval within a year of incurring them; the Executive Director is fully liable for any unapproved expenses that he or she incurs.  II. The rest of this document contains formalities, items that the board is required to review on an annual basis.  Review of compensation arrangements and benefits; partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations  Our bylaws state:  To ensure the corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:   a. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's-length bargaining.   b. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to the corporation's written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes, and do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit, or in an excess benefit transaction.  We maintain that • Compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's-length bargaining. \n\n• We have no noteworthy partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations.  Roster of Officers and Directors. A roster of GiveWell's Officers and Directors follows.  Elie Hassenfeld  Greg Jensen  Holden Karnofsky - Secretary  Tim Ogden - Vice-Chair  Rob Reich  Tom Rutledge - Chair  Brigid Slipka  Phil Steinmeyer  Cari Tuna - Treasurer  Mission and vision statements  Our mission: we find outstanding giving opportunities and publish the full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give.  Our vision: a world in which donors reward effectiveness in improving lives.   Review of insurance coverage  We currently have coverage for Directors & Officer Liability, Employment Practices, Internet Liability, Professional Liability, General Liability, and Property through Philadelphia Insurance Companies.    Our internal procedures state that we will annually review the need for each of the following types of insurance.  I have included notes with each.  • Director and Officers liability.  We are covered. • General liability. We are covered. \n\n• Business travel (can protect against lost property, reimburse for canceled flights, cover health expenses while traveling, etc.1).  We have limited general coverage. We have purchased trip-specific insurance in the past. • Fire/theft.  We have minimal Property insurance.  In addition, all important records, as well as weekly backups of all of our website content are saved to a secondary, off-site server and periodic (at least once per month) backups are maintained electronically on our personal computers and backed up in real-time to a remote server via the Carbonite service. • Employee dishonesty (theft/embezzlement2).  We are not covered. • Hired and non-owned auto.  We are not covered. • Professional Liability (\"protects professional practitioners such as Architects, quantity surveyors, home inspectors, Lawyers, physicians, and Accountants against potential negligence claims made by their patients/clients.\")3  We are covered. • Employment practices.  We are covered. • Workplace violence. We are covered. (This has been added since last insurance review.) • Business interruption.  We are only covered for certain expenses in limited situations. • Hurricane/flood.  See \"Fire/theft\" above.     \n                                                1 http://www.life123.com/career-money/career-development/business-travel/do-you-need-business-travel-insurance.shtml accessed 2/27/2010 2 http://www.naplia.com/employeedishonesty/index.shtml 3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_liability_insurance accessed 2/27/2010 "

When there is a conflict between federal, state and local record retention requirements, the longer retention period prevails. Certain important records, as determined by the Board, will be retained permanently, even if their retention is not required by law.  Record destruction  Once the retention period has expired, The Clear Fund may destroy the records in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of its contents. The Board of Directors approves all destruction of records prior to commencement.  Record destruction is performed under the direction of the Executive Director, who is responsible for maintaining all Certificates of Destruction.  Upon receipt of any legal notice, all record destruction will cease until the end of the investigation, if any.  Review of policy  Record retention requirements are reviewed annually with the Board and independent auditors to determine any necessary changes.

ile: $7.3 million, 75 th percentile: $13 million). This is substantially larger than GiveWell's operating budget, though consistent with a budget that includes our money moved.   The median total compensation for this group is $144,000 (25 th /75 th percentile of $118,000/167,000). Adjusted for the cost​­of­​living in San Francisco, it is $170,000 ($123,000/$199,000).   Details of this data are available ​here​.  Compensation proposal   We propose a salary raise for Holden and Elie from $130,000 to $150,000/year. In addition to salary, GiveWell covers health benefits for employees and their families, which is approximately $5,000​/year per employee. "

Record retention  Clear Fund’s records are retained, in either electronic or paper format,  according to the schedule below, in compliance with government, legal, and funders’ requirements. When there is a conflict between federal, state and local record retention requirements, the longer retention period prevails. Certain important records, as determined by the Board, will be retained permanently, even if their retention is not required by law.  Record destruction  Once the retention period has expired, The Clear Fund may destroy the records in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of its contents. The Board of Directors approves all destruction of records prior to commencement.  Record destruction is performed under the direction of the Executive Director, who is responsible for maintaining all Certificates of Destruction.  Upon receipt of any legal notice, all record destruction will cease until the end of the investigation, if any.

$136,761  $159,186  $180,535 \n \nNotes: \n \n●We have not adjusted for cost­of­living; these five organizations are all headquartered in \ncities in the Northeast and Mid­Atlantic regions. \n●The categorizations required some judgement calls. In particular, we excluded positions \nwith “finance” or “technology” in their name in case technical skills are a major part of \ntheir value. For example, we excluded the GobalGiving Foundation’s “COO & CFO”, and \nincluded their “Chief Business Officer” in the COO category instead. \n●Details of this data are available ​here​. \n \n \nAcademics  \n \nWe think that professors at UC ​Berkeley make for good comparisons because Berkeley is a well​ \nregarded school (and therefore ought to give some indication of what sort of pay attracts top ​tier \nintellectuals in a not​­for­profit environment), is public (so salary information is publicly available), \nand is located in the Bay Area.  \n \n\nWe believe that economics professors make the most appropriate comparison for Holden and \nElie within this data set.  \n \nIn 2013, we found three professors who had received their BAs during or after 2003 (the year \nHolden graduated from college). The total 2011 compensation for these professors was $119K \n(BA in 2008), 121K (BA in 2005), and $174K (BA in 2004). Note that professors typically have \n~3 months per year, and ~1 day per week during the remaining months, for pursuing side \nengagements, including paid ones. Holden and Elie work full­​time at GiveWell. \n \nDetails of this data are available ​here​. \n \nSocial Entrepreneurs \n \nIn late 2013, we reviewed the compensation of key staff (i.e., Chief Executives and other staff \nlisted on form 990s) at other mid­​stage “social entrepreneur”​­led organizations including Center \nfor Effective Philanthropy, Benetech, Kiva, Root Capital, Water for People and VisionSpring.  \n \nThe comparability of these organizations is a substantial judgment call. The median budget size \nfor the organizations we looked at was $10.1 million (25 th percentile: $7.3 million, 75 th \npercentile: $13 million). This is substantially larger than GiveWell's operating budget, though \nconsistent with a budget that includes our money moved.  \n \nThe median total compensation for this group is $144,000 (25 th /75 th percentile of \n$118,000/167,000). Adjusted for the cost​­of­​living in San Francisco, it is $170,000 \n($123,000/$199,000).  \n \nDetails of this data are available ​here​. \n \nCompensation proposal  \n \nWe propose a salary raise for Holden and Elie from $150,000 to $175,000/year. In addition to \nsalary, GiveWell covers health benefits for employees and their families, which is approximately \n$5,000​/year per employee. "

The primary ways we'll have significant impact in the future are by (a) recommending the best giving opportunities we can identify in the area of global health and development and (b) attracting as much funding as possible to those recommendations. 2. It is crucial that GiveWell identify and recommend new giving opportunities.  a. Without new recommendations, we believe that GiveWell would eventually only recommend GiveDirectly (because we believe that, eventually, there is unlikely to be significant room for more funding for deworming and bednets). b. This would cause us to lose existing donors and make it harder to attract new donors, and I believe we can increase our impact by identifying giving opportunities that have more impact per dollar given than GiveDirectly. 3. We intend to find new top charities via (a) work consistent with what we've done historically, (b) additional, specialized hires that will allow us to consider new areas within global health and development (e.g, education, agriculture), and (c) recommending grants (to Good Ventures, Open Philanthropy or others) to support the development of future GiveWell top charities.  4. With new recommendations we will have impact by (a) retaining the donors we have, (b) continuing to attract new donors, and (c) directing that funding to higher impact opportunities than we otherwise would. 5. Operationally: a. We need to increase our focus on strengthening our operations so that we are able to conduct the work above efficiently, effectively and without distraction. We plan to focus on on risk management, donations (and donations processing technology) and back-office operations. b. The Open Philanthropy/GiveWell split will not meaningfully affect GiveWell's funding situation. We are in a stable funding position supported by a diverse set of funders, and we plan to maintain our current approach to budgeting and fundraising. \n\n5) Other topics/questions from the Board  ● Explaining the split to the public "

          "text": " \nError! Unknown document property name.  Minutes for the March 27, 2017 Meeting of The Clear Fund ( dba Givewell)  \nBoard of Directors  \n \nA meeting of the Board of Directors (Board) of The Clear Fund dba GiveWell (GiveWell) was \nheld on March 27, 2017 at 4:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, at the offices of GiveW ell in San \nFrancisco, CA .  Notice was duly and timely given to each member of the Bo ard. \n \nThe following members of the Board were present:  \n Jake Gibson  \n Elie Hassenfeld  \n Holden Karnofsky  \n Timothy Ogden  \n Rob Reich  \n Tom Rutledge  \n Brigid Slipka  \n Phil Steinmeyer (by conference call ) \n Cari Tuna (by conference call ) \n Julia Wise  \n \nThe following individuals were also present:  \n Sarah Ward , Director of Operations, GiveWell  \n Alexander Berger , Open Philanthropy Project LLC  \n Celia Roady , Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP  \n Kimberly Eney , Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP (by conference call)  \n \nTom Rutledg e called the meeting to order, and Sarah Ward presented the agenda . Sarah  noted  \nthat some  Board  members have conflicts  regarding certain items on the agenda, and that those \nmembers will respond to questions and  then leave the room and/or get off the conference line \nwhile the Board engages in deliberation s and voting  on related matters . \n \nOpen Philanthropy Project Split  \n \nTimothy Ogden, Chair of the Open Philanthropy Project Split Subcommittee, updated the Board \non the status of the transfer of the Open Philanthropy Project (Project) to the Open \nPhilanthropy Project LLC (LLC) and reviewed the Subcommittee’s process for considering the  \ntransfer . Tim explained that the Subcommittee hired an independent accounting firm  to \ncomplete a valuation of the assets t hat would be transferred to the LLC.  The Subcommittee also \nengaged Morgan, Lewis & Bockius  LLP to provide legal advice to GiveWell regarding various \naspects of the transaction .  \n \nCelia Roady explained the legal c onsiderations associated with the tran sfer of the Project to the \nLLC, including the relevant requirements under the federal tax laws and state nonprofit \ncorporation law .  \n \nMembers of the Board involved with the LLC disclosed their conflicts. Holden Karnofsky  noted \nthat he  will become a full -time e mployee of the LLC, and Cari Tuna noted that she and her \nhusband, Dustin Moskovitz, expect to be the funders of the LLC. Elie Hassenfeld  will bill some of \nhis time  (initially, approximately 25%)  to the LL C while remaining employe d by GiveWell .  \n\n \n2 Cari, Holden and Elie all anticipate being on the board of the LLC although that has not been \nfinalized. Cari, Holden and Elie confirmed that they will leave the meeting for the Board’s \ndeliberation.   \n \nElie discussed the anticipated impact to GiveWell of the transfer of the Project  to the LLC. He \nnoted that the transfer will enable GiveWell to focus on its core mission and draw clearer \ndistinctions between the activities of GiveWell and the activities of the Project through separate \nbrands, staff, and fund raising. Based on conversations with donors , he indicated that the \ntransfer should have no material impact on GiveWell’s fundraising opportunities  beyond the \nremoval of Good Ventures support for the Project itself . Although s ome GiveWell donors are \nmore interested in supporting the activities of the Project than the activities of GiveWell, this is \nthe exception rather than the rule.  \n \nThe Board discussed possible alternatives to the transfer of the Project to the LLC. Board \nmembe rs noted th at the Project is not income -producing and other purchasers are unlikely . \nBoard members also acknowledged that GiveWell employees who currently work on the Project \ncould always leave GiveWell and work for the LLC.  \n \nThe Board discussed the fact that GiveWe ll and the LLC will  enter into a cost -sharing \nagreement , which will enable GiveWell and the LLC to share services  of certain employees , such \nas operations and reception staff, and certain other expenses on a cost -reimbursement basis. \nBoard members confirmed that the LLC intends to compensate its employees in a similar \nmanner as GiveWell, even though the LLC is not subject to the restrictions applicable to Section \n501(c)(3) organizations.   \n \nThe Board asked Alexander, Holden, and Cari  to provide  information  about the LLC’s anticipated \nactivities. The y confirmed that the LLC does not expect to earn a  profit from commercial \nactivities or investments and that it does not intend for  the LLC’s employees to r eceive  equity or \nother forms of profit -sharing . The activities of the Project will continue to be conducted much \nlike they are conducted today . Cari noted that the Project will be defined under its own terms as \nopposed to as a collaboration between Good Ve ntures and GiveWell. The y also confirmed that \nthe LLC will not compete with Give Well with respect to fundraising. Cari  indicated that her \nintention is to have the sa me relationship with GiveWell that  she has now as a Board member \nand donor.  \n \nTim walked through the negotiation process  with the Board , including some recent changes to \nthe term shee t. He explained that at this meeting the Board needs to approve the overall \nframework for final negotiati ons regarding the term sheet. Celia reminded the B oard that the \nindependent valuation  report presents a range for the fair market value of the assets  that will \nbe transferred to the LLC , and that the Board should consider and rely on a valuation within this \nrange when setting a  price for the sale of asset s. The Board discussed the timing of the \ntransaction and the need to obtain confirmation of the LLC’s authorization of individuals to \nnegotiate on its behalf.   \n \nHolden, Elie, and Alexander left the room, and Cari got off the phone.  \n \nThe Board engaged in further deliberation and debate regarding the term sheet and the \nproposed transfer of the Project to the LLC , including the valuation process.  The Board \n\n \n3 members reiterated the fact that the  transfer of the Project involves a unique tr ansaction , and \nCelia confirmed that the Board can rely on the full range of the fair market valuations presented \nin the independent valuation  report.   \n \nUpon motion duly made and seconded, the non-conflicted members of the Board unanimously \napproved  the resolutions regarding Approval of Process for Negotiating Terms for Acquisition of \nOpen Philanthropy Project by Open Philanthropy Project LLC, which are set forth in Exhibit 1 .   \n \nHolden and Elie joined the meeting, and Cari returned by conference call .  \n \nModification to Excess Assets P olicy  \n \nThe Board members discussed the application of GiveWell’s  excess assets policy  to the funds \nreceived as a result of the transfer of the Project to the LLC . Sarah explained the policy, which \nrequires GiveWell to irrevoc ably earmark for GiveWell’ s recommended charities certain excess  \nrevenue at each budget meeting  of the Board . Tim noted that given an anticipated closing in \nMay and budget meeting in June, the Board will need more time to evaluate its future activities \nbefore applying the excess assets policy to the assets received as a result of the transfer of the \nProjec t. The Board engaged in some deliberation and debate regarding the p roposed revisions \nto the policy and agreed that more time will b e needed to develop a budget against which to \napply the policy to the sale proceeds.   \n \nUpon motion duly made and seconded, the Board unanimously approved the resolutions \nregarding Amendment of the Excess Assets Policy, which are set forth in Exhibit 2 .   \n \nChanging Threshold for Requiring Board Approval  of Expenses  \n \nThe Board discussed  modifying the threshold requirement for the Board’s approval of expenses \nof the organization  under the bylaws . Sarah detailed some of the logistical considerations \nassociated  with the current requirement of Board approval for expenses exceeding $25,000 . \nSarah worked with Morgan, Lewis & Bockius to identify expenses arising outside of the ordinary \ncourse of business as an alternative threshold for the Board’s approval of expenses. The Board \nengaged in some deliberation and debate regarding this proposal. As an alternative, the Board \nsettled on Audit Committee approval for unbudgeted expenses exceeding 3% of GiveWell’s \npreviously -Board approved budget. The Board discussed the fact that this year involved unique \ncircumstances associated with the possible spinout of the Project and decided to se t the \nrequirement at expenses exceeding $60,000 as an approximation until the upcoming  budget \nmeeting in June. In light of these new revisions, Elie requested that the Board approve up to \n$100,000 on the purchase of advertisements  and podcasts  through Vox.  \n \nUpon motion duly made and seconded, the Board unanimously approved  the resoluti ons \nregarding Board Approval of Expenses, which are set forth in Exhibit 3 .  \n \nRatification of the Creation of the Audit Subcommittee and the Strategy \nSubcommittee  \n \nSarah presented some background on the formation of the audit subcommittee and the \nstrategy subcommittee during the summer, and the need for the Board to formally vote to ratify \n\n \n4 the formation of these subcommittees. Upon motion duly made and seconded, the Board \nunanimousl y approved resolutions regarding ratification of the c reation of the Audit \nSubcommittee , which are set forth in Exhibit 4 . The Board also approved resolutions regarding \nthe ratification of the creation of the Strategy Subcommittee, as set forth in Exhibit 4, with \nHolden and Cari abstaining from the vote.  \n \nAdjournment  \n \nMr. Rutledge  thanked all participants for the discussion. There being no further business to \ncome before the Board, the meeting was duly adjourned  at 6:00 pm Pacific Standard Time . \n     \n \n  \n\n \n5 Exhibit 1  \n \nAPPROVAL OF PROCESS FOR NEGOTIATING TERMS FOR ACQUISITION OF OPEN \nPHILANTHROPY PROJECT BY OPEN PHILANTHROPY PROJECT LLC  \n \nWHEREAS, The Clear Fund d/b/a GiveWell (“GiveWell”) is an organization exempt from federal \nincome tax under Section 501(c)(3 ) of the Internal Revenue Code;

Our \"conservative scenario\" projection is $3.4 million.   \n  \n We project the following sources of revenue:  \n  \n 1. Good Ventures ​  has in the last few years supported GiveWell at 20% of its operating  \n expenses. A portion of this gift is in the form of in-kind office space. Total: ​ $0.75 million ​ .   \n 2. A ​ private individual ​  has made large unrestricted gifts to GiveWell. In past years, we  \n have used a portion of the gift, set to 10% of operating expenses, for operating costs,  \n and granted the remainder to top charities. The goal was to limit dependence on a single  \n donor where we didn't have a strong expectation of future giving. We now believe that  \n their is a high likelihood that the donor will support GiveWell at a similar level in future  \n years. We are now proposing to retain 20% of the operating budget and grant out the  \n remainder to top charities. Total: ​ $0.75 million ​ .   \n 3. We are projecting that ​ donors giving less than $10,000 ​  will in aggregate give ​ $1.09  \n million ​ , up from $0.8 million in 2016. The projection for 2017 is considerably higher than  \n 2016 actual because $0.36 million was received from this group of donors in the first  \n quarter of 2017.  1\n 1  The 2017 projected total includes actuals for Q1 and, for the remainder of the year, projects 10% growth  \n over the total from donors giving less than $10,000 in 2016. Growth in this category was about 10% in  \n 2016 over 2015; in the two years prior to that it was ~40% growth per year. 10% growth in 2017 is likely  \n conservative given strong growth in Q1.  \n\n4. We are projecting ​  $1.46 million ​  from ​ donors giving over $10,000 ​ , compared with  \n $1.55 million in 2016.   2\n  \n The conservative projection excludes:  \n 1. Donors who have given $10,000 before but have not given consistently or who we have  \n reason to believe may not give again. (In the main projection, these donor's past giving  \n is discounted for expected value based on past experience.)  \n 2. Revenue from new major donors (those giving over $10,000 who have not given at this  \n level before).   \n 3. Half of projection of funding from donors giving less than $10,000.  \n Assets  \n  \n Balance of unrestricted funds, end of 2016: $4.66 million  \n Estimated balance of unrestricted funds, end of April 2017: $5.31 million (of which, we are  \n proposing to restrict $0.96 million—see above). This estimate has not been confirmed by our  \n accountants.   \n Projected revenue excluded from this document  \n  \n The above does not include:  \n 1. Funding from Good Ventures for 2017 GiveWell budget. We plan to submit a request for  \n $0.53 million after the board has approved the budget.  \n 2. Funding from Good Ventures to cover Open Philanthropy Project expenses between  \n when the last grant ended at the end September 2016 and the Open Phil spin-off on  \n June 1, 2017. Good Ventures has not committed to making such a grant, but we believe  \n it will do so. We will have a precise figure after we close our books for May; we currently  \n anticipate that this request will be between $2 and $3 million.  \n 3. Proceeds from the sale of assets to Open Philanthropy Project LLC ($2.65 million).  \n Funds were received on May 31.  \n Excess assets policy  \n  \n With current projections, ​ our excess assets policy ​  is not triggered. The policy may be triggered  \n after accounting for the sale of assets to Open Philanthropy Project LLC and if GiveWell  \n 2  The projection includes both (a) analysis of individual donors' past giving and an expected value of  \n future given based on past patterns of donor attrition (as well as actual giving in Q1), and (b) a projection  \n of giving from new donors (or, more specifically, donors who have not given a major unrestricted gift to  \n GiveWell before). Part (b) incorporates actual giving in Q1 and, for the remainder of the year, an average  \n of new major giving in 2014-2016. As with smaller gifts, the model assumes that 50% of the total will be  \n given in December and the remaining 50% evenly spread out throughout the year.   \n\nreceives a grant from Good Ventures to cover Open Philanthropy expenses between October  \n 2016 and May 2017 (see above).

Elie currently receives no non-salary compensation from GiveWell.  \n  \n Foundations   \n  \n We have private data from a 2016 survey of 131 foundations by Lasnik- ​ Broida Consultants, Inc.  \n in collaboration with The Croner Company. Below is aggregate information about total  \n compensation for CEOs among foundations with 16-50 employees.  \n  \n CEO Compensation at Foundations with 16-50 employees   \n (n = 52)  \n  25th percentile  50th percentile  75th percentile  \n Base pay  $378,000  $427,500  $529,900  \n Total  \n compensation  $449,000  $504,900  $649,600  \n  \n And here is the aggregate information about total compensation for CEOs among foundations  \n with more than $1.5 billion in assets.  \n  \n CEO Compensation at Foundations with more than $1.5 billion in assets  \n (n = 36, overlaps with above)  \n  25th percentile  50th percentile  75th percentile  \n Base pay  $561,000  $671,500  $763,100  \n Total  \n compensation  $675,600  $781,100  $981,500  \n  \n Notes:   \n  \n\n● These data are not adjusted for cost- ​ of- ​ living, although most of the foundations are  \n based in large American cities.  \n ● The 36 foundations surveyed with $1.5 billion in assets or more had a median grants  \n payout of $124 million. GiveWell's estimate of 2016 money moved is slightly more than  \n $100 million (approximately $92 million to top charities and $10 million to GiveWell  \n Incubation Grants.)  1\n ● Details of this data and definitions are available in Exhibit A.  \n  \n Research not-for-profits  \n  \n We pulled the available staff compensation information from eight research or  \n charity-review-oriented not-for-profits: Innovations for Poverty Action, IDinsight, Evidence  \n Action, Center for Global Development, Center for Effective Philanthropy, Urban Institute,  \n Guidestar, and Charity Navigator.  \n  \n Here are the summary statistics for the salaries of the president, CEO, or Executive Director at  \n those organizations in their 2015 990s:  \n  \n Compensation for Presidents and/or CEOs at 8 orgs from 2015 990s  \n  25th percentile  50th percentile  75th percentile  \n Base pay  $163,350  $221,091  $331,952  \n Total compensation  $190,701  $231,317  $426,458  \n  \n Notes:  \n ● We have not adjusted for cost ​ -of- ​ living.  \n ● The categorizations required some judgement calls. In particular, both Evidence Action  \n and Charity Navigator experienced executive turnover in 2015. We prorated the salaries  \n for both Evidence Action executive directors over one calendar year. Charity Navigator’s  \n second CEO in 2015 did not receive a salary in 2015 and we excluded him from the  \n dataset.  \n ● Details of this data are available in Exhibit B.  \n  \n Academics   \n  \n We think that professors at UC Berkeley make for good comparisons because Berkeley is a well  \n regarded school (and therefore ought to give some indication of what sort of pay attracts top tier  \n intellectuals in a not ​ for ​ profit environment), is public (so salary information is publicly available),  \n and is located in the Bay Area.  \n 1  We chose this tier because it was the closest to GiveWell's money moved. The next tier down in the  \n compensation survey we relied on had a median annual grants payout of $32 million.  \n\n \n We believe that economics professors make the most appropriate comparison for Elie within this  \n data set.  \n  \n Below are summary statistics for the compensation of Berkeley economics professors in 2014.  \n  \n  \n Compensation for UC Berkeley economics professors in 2014   \n (n = 41)  \n  25th percentile  50th percentile  75th percentile  \n Base pay  $143,450  $226,392  $269,833  \n Total compensation  $183,550  $264,414  $336,367  \n   \n  \n We found six professors who had received their BAs in 2004 or later (the year Elie  \n graduated from college). The total compensation for each of these professors was $57K (BA in  \n 2009),  $159K (BA in 2008), $153K (BA in 2006), $184K (BA In 2005), $169K (BA in 2004), and  2\n $227K (BA in 2004). Note that professors typically have ~3 months per year, and ~1 day per  \n week during the remaining months, for pursuing side engagements, including paid ones. Elie  \n works full ​ -time at GiveWell.  \n  \n Details of this data are available in Exhibit B.  \n  \n Compensation proposal  \n  \n We propose a compensation raise for Elie from $175,000 to $200,000 per year. Elie currently  \n receives no non-salary compensation from GiveWell.  \n  \n 2  ​ We suspect that this professor may not have been employed by Berkeley for the entire 2014 calendar  \n year. His CV just indicates that he started in 2014: ​ http://philippstrack.com/files/StrackCVMar2015.pdf  "

          "text": " \n What are GiveWell's major priorities over the next 3 -5 years?  \n \nThis document lists our major priorities by functional area: research, operations, and outreach.  \n \nResearch  \n \nThe success GiveWell has had to date has been due to the quality of our research, so the items \nbelow are crucial to our continued success.  \n \n1. Maintain and improve our product . Among other things, this means that we will continue to \n(a) update our views on our current to p charities, (b) look for and find new top charities and \ninterventions, (c) revise and improve our cost -effectiveness analysis, (d) through GiveWell \nIncubation Grants, continue to identify opportunities to generate more top charity contenders \nby funding re search, start -up charities and improved monitoring all while maintaining the \nsame level of transparency that we have to date.  \na. As part of maintaining the quality of GiveWell's recommendations, we plan to formally \nrevisit the focus on global health and deve lopment (GH&D). GiveWell chose to focus \non GH&D because our early research (2007 -2010) convinced us that GH&D offered \nthe best giving opportunities that met our criteria. However, at its core, GiveWell is \nnot focused on GH&D; we're focused on the best givi ng opportunities that are \nevidence -backed, cost -effective and have room for more funding. While our \nexpectation is that revisiting this decision will lead us to maintain our focus on GH&D, \nwe plan to revisit this decision. The points below assume that we c ontinue to focus \non GH&D.  \n2. Comprehensively survey program areas in GH&D and have compelling answers for \nwhy we recommend the programs we do, and why we don't recommend others.  \nGiveWell has looked at many programs, but there remain many that we haven't exami ned in \ndepth. For example, we would like to have a more systematic view of education, agriculture, \nreproductive health, and surgical interventions. There are also more general areas we \nhaven't formally evaluated such as health systems strengthening and dis ease elimination or \neradication programs. We plan to do research that allows us to assess these programs and \neither make them priority programs (and seek out charities that implement them) or formally \nexplain why we do not believe they are promising.  \na. This may also include approaches to GH&D that go beyond direct program delivery. \nFor example, philanthropy that aims to improve tobacco or road safety regulations \nglobally to improve health and reduce disability. As has been the case, such \nprograms would need t o be evidence -backed, cost -effective, and scalable to be \npriority programs.  \n3. All charities that should be top charities are top charities . Currently, we may not \nrecommend some charities for reasons including (a) they misunderstand us, our value -\nadded, or ou r process so they don't apply, (b) we haven't completed the work to assess the \nevidence for the intervention they implement (see the bullet above), or (c) we have limited \ncapacity and have prioritized our work such that we haven't yet been able to review s ome \npromising organizations. GiveWell should eventually overcome this hurdle and should be \nconfident that all charities that exist that would meet our criteria are recommended.  \n\n \n 4. GiveWell has created the mechanism and incentive for people to start organizati ons \nthat could meet our criteria.  Taken together, we believe that the work laid out above will \ncreate the incentive for people to try to create high -impact nonprofits that meet our criteria \nbecause we can offer (a) financial support to people who want to s tart an organization, \nconduct early stage research or add M&E to a program they're already running through the \nGiveWell Incubation Grants program, (b) predictable criteria to determine whether or not an \norganization will be recommended, and (c) significant  funding if the organization succeeds.  \n \nThis is important because other than GiveWell we believe that these incentives are not \nnearly strong enough. GiveWell is uniquely positioned because we can offer both early stage \nfinancial support but also significa nt funding to groups at scale. We believe that creating a \nstrong incentive for people to create high -impact organizations is a way through which we \ncould have significant long -term impact beyond the funding we move directly to our \nrecommendations.  \n \n \nOutreach  \n \nWe have historically put limited time into proactive outreach and have consistently treated \nresearch as a higher organizational priority. Given the quality of our research, we now believe \nthat outreach is at a similar priority level to research a nd we anticipate allocating significant \ncapacity to it in the future.  \n \n1. We aim to significantly increase our money moved . Specifically, our non -Good Ventures \nmoney moved is currently approximately $40 million annually. We aim to increase that figure \nto $100  million annually. We do not have specific goals for whether this comes from one (or \nrelatively few) major donor(s) or a large number of smaller donors: our focus is on the \namount of funding we direct.  \na. In 2016, Good Ventures gave approximately $60 million to our recommendations \n($50 million to top charities and $10 million to GiveWell Incubation Grants). We \nexpect this funding to continue.  \n \nOperations / organizational goals  \n \nBefore mid -2016, we treated operations as a low priority, and we have a lot of work  to do to improve \nit. It is important that we get to a situation where:  \n \n1. GiveWell has high -quality operations . Our operations infrastructure, including our work in \ndonations processing, finance, legal, HR, tech, and office management, is high -quality and \ncan support our research and outreach goals.   \n2. GiveWell is a robust organization whose success does not rely on any one individual. \nFor all staff members, we have a contingency plan and ability to thrive if we lose any \nindividual.  "

Minutes for the April 25 , 2017 Meeting of The Clear Fund ( dba GiveW ell) \nBoard of Directors  \n \nA meeting of the Board of Directors (Board) of The Clear Fund dba GiveWell (GiveWell) was \nheld on April 25, 2017 at 3:30  p.m. Pacific Standard Time, by conference call .  Directors not in \nattendance waived notice of the meeting.  \n \nThe following members of t he Board were present  (by conference call) :  \n Jake Gibson  \n Greg Jensen  \n Timothy Ogden  \n Rob Reich  \n Tom Rutledge  \n Brigid Slipka  \n Phil Steinmeyer  \n Julia Wise  \n \nThe following individuals were also present  (by conference call) :  \n Sarah Ward , Director of Operations, GiveWell  \n Celia Roady, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP  \n \nTom Rutledge called the meeting to order, and Sarah Ward presented the agenda .  \n \nApproval of Minutes for the March 27, 2017 Meeting  \n \nUpon motion duly made and seconded, the Board approved the Minutes for the March 27, 2017 \nMeeting of the Clear Fund (dba GiveWell) Board of Directors.  \n \nOpen Philanthropy Project Split  \n \nTimothy Ogden, Chair of the Open Philanthropy Project Split Subcommittee, updated the Board \non the status o f the proposed transfer of the Open Philanthropy Project (Project) to the Open \nPhilanthropy Project LLC (LLC) and reviewed the Subcommittee’s process for considering the  \ntransfer . Tim explained that the Subcommittee received documentation of the LLC’s \nauthorization of Rakesh Mehta and Alexander Berger to negotiate, on behalf of the LLC, the \nterms and conditions of the transfer. Tim also explained that the Subcommittee received a non -\nbinding statement from the LLC about its intended future governance plans.   \n \nTim pointed the Board to the term sheet (“Term Sheet”), which reflects the Subcommittee’s \nfinal negotiations with the LLC regarding the major terms of the transfer of the Project to the \nLLC. Tim also reminded the Board that the Subcommittee hired an independent accounting firm  \nto complete a valuation of the assets that would be transferred to the LLC. Tim walked through \nthe methodologies employed by the independent accounting firm  to estimate a  fair ma rket \nvalue range  for the assets contemplated to be transferred to the LLC .  \n \nTim walked the Board through the other terms in the Term Sheet. He explained that the \nSubcommittee wanted to ensure that the LLC would be willing to license certain IP created in \nconnection with the Project to GiveWell  so it can post information on its website for historical \n\n \n2 \n purposes and use other IP for future projects.  Tim noted proposed terms for the allocation of \nrisks and liabilities  between GiveWell and the LLC. Tim also mentioned the terms governing the \ntransfer of Project grant agreements  and certain other contracts from GiveWell to the LLC , \ntransition issues related to employees and contractors , spinoff transaction costs, the cost -\nsharing agreement between the parties, and future profit-sharing (under which the LLC will \nagree to donate any profits it realizes from certain commercial activities or investments during \nits first three fiscal years to GiveWell recommended charities).  \n \nThe Board engaged in further de liberation and debate regarding the Term S heet and the \nproposed transfer of the Project to the LLC , including the valuation process.  The Board \nmembers reiterated the fact that the  transfer of the Project involves a unique transaction  and \nthat the Board can  rely on the full range of the fair market valuations presented in the \nindependent valuation  report.   \n \nRob Reich, a member of the Subcommittee, noted that he believes the transaction to be in \nGiveWell’s  best interests relative to alternatives, including the possibility of GiveWell staff \nmembers separating  from GiveWell and joining the LLC  (independent of any transaction to sell \nthe Project assets to the LLC ). Rob stated  that he thinks separating the Project from GiveWell \nwill allow  GiveWell to focus on its original mission.  \n \nTom Rutledge asked the Board members to raise any concerns they may have about the \nproposed transaction or the terms set forth in the Term Sheet. The Board raised no concerns.  \n \nUpon motion duly made and seconded, the members of the Board present (none of which had a \nconflict of interest) unanimously approved  the resolutions regarding Approval of the Open \nPhilanthropy Project Split, which are set forth in Exhibit 1 .   \n \nThe Subcommittee mentioned that it is hoping to close the Open Philanthropy Project split \ntransaction by  May 31, 2017.  \n \nThe Board members discussed the agenda for the June 6, 2017 Board meeting, which  the \nBoard agreed will include further  discussion of Gi veWell’s future after the spinoff of the Project.  \n \n \nAdjournment  \n \nTim thanked all participants for the discussion. There being no further business to come before \nthe Board, the meeting was duly adjourned  at 4:30 pm Pacific Standard Time . \n     \n \n    \n \n  \n\n \n3 \n Exhibit 1  \n \nAPPROVAL OF THE OPEN PHILANTHROPY PROJECT SPLIT  \n \nWHEREAS, The Clear Fund d/b/a GiveWell (“GiveWell”) is an organization exempt from federal \nincome tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;  \n \nWHEREAS, GiveWell has operated the Open  Philanthropy Project (“Project”) as one of its \nprograms to give effectively and share its findings openly so that anyone can build on its work;  \n \nWHEREAS, GiveWell received a request from the Open Philanthropy Project LLC (“LLC”) to \npurchase the assets of the Project for no less than the fair market value of such assets;  \n \nWHEREAS, the LLC was established to, among other things, support a range of philanthropic \nendeavors;  \n \nWHEREAS, the Board established the GiveWell, Open Philanthropy Split Subcommittee \n(“Subcommittee”) as an independent committee of the Board to evaluate the potential sale of \nthe Project to the LLC and to report on the considerations regarding such a sale to the Board;  \n \nWHEREAS, at the meeting of the Board on March 27, 2017, the Subcommi ttee reported to the \nBoard on the considerations involved in the sale of the Project to the LLC, and the Board \nevaluated these and additional considerations, including the alternatives to such a sale and any \nmore advantageous arrangements, the Board’s fidu ciary obligations, and the findings of the \nvaluation report, dated March 17, 2017, from an independent expert regarding the fair market \nvalue of the assets of the Project (“Valuation”); and  \n \nWHEREAS, the Board authorized Timothy Ogden and Rob Reich to ente r into negotiations with \nthe LLC regarding the terms associated with the sale of the Project to the LLC, and such parties \nhave entered into final negotiations regarding these terms, as reflected in the term sheet set \nforth on Attachment A  (“Term Sheet”).  \n \nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that, in reliance on the information set forth in the \nValuation, the independent members of the Board, acting without the presence of any \nconflicted members of the Board, hereby approve the sale of the Project to the LLC upo n the \nterms set forth in the Term Sheet, finding such a sale to be fair, reasonable, in the best \ninterests of GiveWell, and for GiveWell’s own benefit.  \n \nFURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board’s approval of the terms set forth in the Term Sheet shall \nbe contingen t on a final list of assets that reflects the scope of assets set forth in the valuation \nreport and any additional assets that have no ascertainable value.  \n \nFURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board hereby authorizes Timothy Ogden and any persons that \nTimothy Ogden  may designate (which shall be limited to Sarah Ward and any non -conflicted \nofficers of GiveWell) to negotiate the final details of the transaction and enter into agreements \nwith the LLC in accordance with the Term Sheet.  \n \n\n \n4 \n FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board hereby authorizes Timothy Ogden, Sarah Ward, and the \nnon-conflicted officers of GiveWell to do and perform all such further acts and to execute such \ndocuments as shall be necessary or advisable in order to carry out the foregoing resolutions.  \n "

Research : aimed at identifying outstanding giving opportunities and publish ing our \nreasoning  \n2. Outreach : aimed at increasing the amount of money that goes to our recommendations  \n3. Operations : aimed at supporting the above two goals via donation processing, HR, \nfinance and accounting, office management and legal.  \n \nBelow, this document discusses our top priorities in each domain in details. He re, we briefly \nsummar ize: \nResearch  \nOur research team is in good shape. Our team is able to effectively research and publish \nreports on the giving opportunities we want to consider. There are problems we need to fix but \nthe team has the capacity to make the  necessary changes. Adding additional capacity to the \nresearch team would allow us to move faster / do more, but it wouldn't change the types of \nresearch we're able to do.  \nOutreach  \nWe put limited capacity into outreach historically, and it has significant  room for improvement.  \n \nThe consistency of our outreach to major donors has improved significantly since we hired \nCatherine Hollander (our only staff member dedicated to outreach), but she's capacity \nconstrained: we don't reach out to as many donors as we ideally would.  \n \nIn addition, we have historically put limited effort into proactively increasing the amount of \nfunding we direct to our top charities. We see a major potential opportunity to increase our \nmoney moved with a thoughtful strategy.  \n \nDeveloping  a promising strategy for outreach that increases our money moved as much as \npossible is a top organizational priority.  \nOperations  \nWe're in the process of building an operations team led by Sarah Ward (Director of Operations). \nWe still have room for improv ement but the team effectively executes all its day -to-day \nresponsibilities, and if it continues on its current trajectory, will be significantly improved in the \nnear future.  \n\n \n Current Vision and Mission Statements  \n \nMission: GiveWell finds and supports the d evelopment of outstanding giving opportunities and \npublishes the full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give.  \n \nVision: a world in which donors reward charities for effectiveness in improving lives.  \nHow aligned is current state and curr ent operations to these statements? If not well aligned, do \nthey need review? Do priorities need to be realigned?  \nWith a small edit, the mission statement reflects what we're doing.  \n \nThe vision seems fine.  \nExecutive Leadership  \nName Elie’s Top 3 priorities /investment areas with goals/metrics and relative priority of each  \n \nThese are listed in order of priority:  \n \n1. Maximize the long term impact of staff, especially my reports.  \na. For my reports (Natalie, Josh, Sarah and Catherine):  \ni. Do this via coaching, assessment , mentorship, training focusing both in \ntheir project work and contributions and leadership/management \ndevelopment.  \nii. This includes working with them to set priorities and goals for them and \ntheir teams (when applicable) and checking in to ensure their acti ons are \nconsistent with agreed upon goals.  \niii. The goals / metrics varies by each person, so we should discuss what \nsorts of goals/metrics would be most useful. At a high level, in most \ncases, my goal is to expand the scope of what each person can do while \nlimiting the time I spend.  \nb. For the rest of staff:  \ni. Set culture and key improvements in culture/work environment. My \nassessment is that there are aspects of our culture/work environment we \nshould work to resolve, but that a relatively low intensity effort (i.e., being \naware of and diligent about improvements) will likely yield sufficient \nresults.  \nii. We recently retained a consultant to conduct interviews with all staff to \nidentify problems. That project led us to settle on two major improvements \nwe intend to a im to improve on. They are:  \n1. Responding to ideas and critiques. A core value of GiveWell's is \nthat we make decisions based on reason, logic, and evidence. It's \n\n \n clear from the feedback that staff perceive some decisions as \nbeing made suboptimally, with a bia s towards the status quo and \naway from new ideas.  \n2. Performance feedback. The way in which management, myself \nincluded, has communicated with many on staff about your \nperformance and trajectory has caused confusion, anxiety, \nuncertainty, and lack of motivati on. \niii. We don't believe we can easily track this quantitatively. Instead, we plan \nto qualitatively track this via:  \n1. Elie's meetings 1:1 with all staff. (I meet with everyone at GiveWell \nat least 1x/quarter.)  \n2. Manager s' 1:1s with direct reports. (Managers have 1 :1s with \nreports 1x/week.)  \n3. Incorporating questions about the above into exit interviews  \n4. Running a similar process to interview staff about problems next \nyear (~April 2018) to see whether we have made progress  \nc. Recruiting - low level since other staff lead m ost proactive efforts, but keep an \neye out for great people/other vendors we might be able to retain. This may \nbecome a higher priority if/when we aim to hire more senior staff (most likely in \noutreach).  \n2. Decisions I make and/or work I do directly (e.g., w eigh in on research conclusions, \nIDinsight relationship, GIG investigations, recruiting plans and decisions)  \na. I still spend a significant time leading research projects or weighing in on \ndecisions that aren't explicitly targeted at developing staff.  \nb. My goal here is to reduce the amount of time I spend on this bucket by working \non priority #1 above.  \n3. Develop a plan and lead long -term project to increase GW money moved  \na. We have a long -term goal of substantially increasing our money moved. We're \naiming to dev elop a more concrete plan for how we intend to accomplish this by \nthe end of the 3rd quarter of 2017.  \nb. Metrics:  \ni. Short -term: do we have a solid plan by the end of 3Q 2017  \nii. Long -term: does money moved reach $100m, ex -Good Ventures by \ngiving season 2022.  \n \nVery roughly speaking, I'd guess that, over the past 6 months, priority #1 above has accounted \nfor 60%, #2 30% of my time/attention, and #3 10% of my attention but I expect that #3 will \nincrease substantially over the next 6 months.  \nDiscuss relative priority/i nvestment in each of three major domains (research, operations, and \noutreach)  \n \nIn the first half of 2017, I spent ~60% of my GiveWell time on research, 20% on operations and \n20% on outreach. (I spent 88% of my work hours on GiveWell and 12% on Open Philant hropy.)  \n\n \n  \nI allocated the most time to research because it has historically been our top organizational \npriority, and my contributions have been necessary to move it forward as effectively as possible.  \n \nI expect that I'll devote more of my capacity to outreach in the future and continue to delegate \nas much research ownership as possible to Josh and Natalie so that I can focus on outreach. I \nexpect that my research hours fall and my outreach hours rise in the 2nd half of the year.  \n \nI don't think I'll all ocate more time and attention to operations. Sarah Ward is running that team \nand I think that that team will be successful without significantly more engagement from me; as \nSarah gets more experience, I expect the time I spend on operations to fall.  \nWhy do es this shift make sense?  \nOur research is our product, so it has to remain high quality. I also suspect, based to some \nextent on intuition and to some extent on my subjective impression of donors' reactions to our \nresearch between 2013 and 2015 when we did n't produce a large amount of new research, that \nour research has to continue to improve and push new frontiers to maintain donors' belief that \nGiveWell represents the gold standard for recommendations to donors.  \n \nOver the past 18 months, a few things have  changed:  \n1. Our research capacity has increased substantially as we've added some new staff and \nexisting staff have matured. Excluding me, our research staff is able to cover a lot of \nground and continue to push our research to explore new areas.  \n2. The room fo r more funding among our recommendations has surpassed our money \nmoved. Several years ago, we estimated moderate room for more funding among our \ntop charities, and we worried about the possibility of finding new charities with additional \nroom for more fund ing. This has changed. Our estimated room for more funding at our \ntop charities exceeded our money moved by more than $100 million last year, excluding \nGiveDirectly. In addition, GiveWell Incubation Grants are starting to generate larger \ngiving opportuniti es, and we've heard from top charities that some are nervous about our \ntotal funding capacity.  \n3. Good Ventures is unlikely to give much more than $60 million to our recommendations in \nthe near future. Previously, it seemed plausible that Good Ventures would decide to give \nsubstantially more to our recommendations.  \n \nAt the same time, we have made some progress on outreach by hiring Catherine, and our \nrelations with existing donors are in good shape. However, we have made virtually no effort \nraise additional fu nding. I don't think we currently have the capacity on staff to sufficiently push \noutreach forward, which requires determining our strategy and deciding who to hire, unless I \nfocus on it.  \n\n \n Research  \nName top 3 goals/metrics in research  \n \nThese are our four t op priorities, in order of importance:  \n \n1. Maintain our current product: follow and stay up -to-date on current top charities, \nstandouts and interventions; assess new charities and interventions that appear to be \npromising based on our current criteria and ass essment of interventions; release new \nrecommendations annually; maintain quality standards for research.  \na. Priority/time allocation: This is our core product offering (i.e., our annual release \nof new top charities). We have worked hard to limit the amount of  work that goes \ninto this to the minimum necessary. Currently, this work is led by Natalie \n(accounting for ~50% of her time). Natalie manages a team of 4 people, and I'd \nroughly estimate that 2/3 of their time is devoted to this goal. In addition, Josh \nspends a small amount of time (~10%) on intervention updates.  \nb. Metrics:  \ni. Do we stay up -to-date on our top charities and interventions and release \na high -quality update before December 1st?  \nii. How many new charities do we assess?  \niii. How many promising interventions do  we complete thorough reviews of?  \niv. How much capacity/time does it take to accomplish this goal, especially \nfocused on updating our views on top charities and top charities' \ninterventions?  \n2. Intervention prioritization: There are many interventions we haven't sufficiently assessed \nto have compelling reasons to not prioritize. This work aims to more systematically follow \nand assess interventions that could lead to top charities.  \na. Metrics:  \ni. How many new interventions do we assess at a shallow and medium \nlevel?  \nii. How promising do these interventions appear to be as measured by (a) \nestimated cost -effectiveness and (b) plausibility as GiveWell top \ncharities?  \niii. Does this work lead to new top charities or new Incubation Grants?  \n3. Build for the future: work we do today that won 't lead to significant impacts in the next 1 -\n2 years but we expect to have longer -term benefits. This is mostly (a) ongoing recruiting \nefforts and (b) work on GiveWell Incubation Grants.  \na. Metrics:  \ni. Do our recruiting efforts lead to hires that contribute sign ificantly to \nGiveWell's research?  \n1. [Redaction]  \nii. Do our Incubation Grants lead to new top charities?  \niii. Do our grants lead to high quality public evidence on promising \ninterventions (whether or not they turn into top charities)?  \n\n \n 4. Improve the robustness of our to ols (e.g., our cost -effectiveness model): our decisions \nare a function of the data we have and the tools we use to analyze that data. Flaws in \nthose tools can lead us to make poor decisions. This work aims to improve the reliability \nof the tools we use.  \na. Metrics:  \ni. Do we successfully address and reduce the number of major \nproblems/weaknesses we see in our tools? How many problems do we \naddress?  \nDiscuss why you believe in this relative priority (facts, experience, external input)  \n● Why is #1 prioritized most high ly? \n○ Intuitively, it's compelling to me that GiveWell should be wary of letting the quality \nand scope of its research product degrade given that we've been successful with \nthis product and we're not allocating an undue amount of capacity to it.  \n○ Conversatio ns with major donors often focus on (a) updates on our top charities \nand (b) information about new top charities we're actively considering. These two \ntopics are the ones that major donors ask about most often. My impression from \nthose conversations is tha t they expect us to have a good understanding of those \norganizations and what they're doing.  \n■ When we had no new top charities in 2014 and 2015, it seemed as if \ndonors and followers closest to us were skeptical of the value of our \nongoing work. New top char ities (especially Malaria Consortium, \nimplementing a new intervention) helped to address these concerns.  \n● Why is intervention prioritization prioritized 2nd?  \n○ In our experience, the decisive factor in our charity recommendation is the \nevidence base and cost -effectiveness of interventions. We've consistently had \nthe experience that intervention results (strength of evidence and cost -\neffectiveness) drive our final  conclusions significantly more than organizational \nfactors do (see this post  discussing GiveDirectly vs SCI as an example). We \ntherefo re believe that assessing interventions is key to identifying charities that \nwe'll ultimately decide are as good as or better than our top charities.  \n○ We view this as a high priority because we know that are numerous interventions \nin addition to large areas  (such as education or agriculture) that we haven't \nrecently assessed. I'd guess that the domains we haven't investigated (both \nspecific interventions and larger domains like education and agriculture) in depth \nrepresent some of the most likely areas where  we'll find new priority programs as \npromising or more promising than our top charities.  \n○ There will come a point where we complete this work and can lower its priority. In \nthe next 12 -24 months, I expect we'll make substantial progress on this work and \nhave a much better sense for whether we should continue this work or \nchange/stop it. My best guess is that this will move to a much lower priority within \nthe next two years (most likely subsumed under the goal above taking \nsignificantly less capacity).  \n● Why is  GIG/building for the future prioritized 3rd?  \n\n \n ○ GIG \n■ Over the past few years, we've struggled to find new top charities that are \nas promising as or more promising than our current top charities. \nNotwithstanding the bullet above about intervention prioritization, I'd \nguess that we've done a fairly good job identifying the low hanging fruit in \nGiveWell's first 10 years. GIG -- directly supporting the development of \nnew top charities -- offers an opportunity to grow this pool directly.  \n■ Deciding how mu ch capacity to direct to GIG has been challenging. Over \nthe past 18 months, I've devoted a significant amount of my time to \nbuilding the program. I've also tasked other staff members -- Natalie, \nJosh, and Sophie, in particular -- who've all played signific ant roles. I now \nbelieve the program is operating well in that (a) we have grants/ongoing \nprojects that cover the full scope of the GIG pipeline (impact \nevaluation/research, seed funding, and M&E support) and (b) important \npotential partners (JPAL, IPA, CH AI, CEGA, Guide at Georgetown, GIF, \nDIV, IDinsight, Evidence Action, the EA community) are aware of and \nreach out to us about potential grant opportunities, but (c) we have little \ninformation/reason to believe that the bets we've made (bets that specific \ngrants will lead to new top charities) will succeed. I'm hesitant to invest \nmore -- funding or capacity -- in this area until we have a better sense of \nhow well our bets will work out. (We expect the first concrete evaluation of \nthis strategy to come the fa ll of 2017 when we evaluate No Lean Season, \nan early GIG grantee for a top charity recommendation).  \n■ We're currently allocating time to GIG to maintain our current set of \npriorities and we're opportunistically considering additional grants if/when \nthey seem  particularly promising relative to our current portfolio, but we're \nnot proactively trying to grow the portfolio.  \n○ With recruitment, we have slowly built our research team and don't see pressing \nconcrete gaps to fill.  \n■ It's possible that we'll want to add additional specialists to evaluate \nliterature, but we're in the process of evaluating / will be in the process of \nevaluating two this fall (Caitlin and Stephan), and I'd like to get a better \nsense of their capabilities before hiring more.  \n■ Otherwise, we're aiming to try to add other people who are similar to \nresearch staff who've been most successful in the past, i.e., values -\naligned, technical people who have some work experience. We don't \ncurrently see other gaps we think we could/should realistically try to fill.  \n● Improving tools such as our cost -effectiveness model  \n○ This is prioritized last because, based on past experience of (a) reanalyzing our \ntools or (b) donors scrutinizing our tools, I think it's likely that GiveWell would be \nOK -- survive/continue to  thrive -- even if our tools remain suboptimal for the next \ncouple of years. That's because we haven't historically fundamentally changed \nour conclusions based on reassessing our tools and donors have rarely been \ndisappointed by the quality of our research . \n\n \n ○ Nonetheless, I think a crucial part of our past success -- both consistently \nimproving the quality of our research and analysis and showing donors that our \nresearch is high quality -- has been due to offering the highest quality research \nwe can.  \n○ Given t hat we see important gaps in the quality of our tools, we want to work to \nimprove them. I'm worried about the long -term success of a GiveWell that \nactively ignores known, obvious weaknesses in its methods.  \nDiscuss what it would take to change your perspect ive \n \nBelow, I'm going to list a bunch of things we could do differently and then follow it up with what \nwould cause me to change my mind about each.  \nThings we could do differently on research:  \n \n1. More work on GIG via more networking/searching for grant oppor tunities and allocating \nmore of the funding we influence to GIG. One easy type of grant we could make more of \nwould be supporting the developing of high quality M&E systems for charities who might \nbe recommended if they had that.  \n2. Deepen our knowledge about  top charities via more closely following them and more site \nvisits  \n3. New approaches to serve other donors: we could focus our research on trying to bring in \nmore donors researching and writing about causes / topics that we think will get us \nattention (e.g.,  disaster relief)  \n4. Intellectual home of giving blog: when Holden was blogging regularly, the GiveWell blog \nwas a place where we published posts about philosophy/theory of giving. With Holden's \nmove to Open Philanthropy, we've stopped this.  \n5. Be helpful to bil lionaires/foundations: we could pivot and take a more consultant -like \napproach to understanding what UHNW donors want and trying to give that to them  \n6. A subset of this sort of work would be focusing research that might be useful in \ninfluencing bilaterals. S ome specific possibilities: evaluations of major recipients of \nbilateral funding (the Global Fund, GAVI, UNICEF); evaluations of elimination vs control \ncampaigns for malaria or NTDs.  \n7. Change approach and try to evaluate more charities more shallowly: we co uld go back \nto our original vision and try to create a menu of charities that we evaluate at a shallow \nlevel.  \n8. Focus evaluation on charities instead of interventions: we could go back to what \nGiveWell did c. 2009 -2011 and focus more of our energy on findin g, talking to, and \nevaluating charities independent of the independent evidence for the effectiveness/cost -\neffectiveness of their intervention  \n9. Make GW research smaller: we could scale down our staff and focus research primarily \non goal #1 above -- maintain  our traditional top charities product.  \n\n \n What would cause me to prioritize X more highly than we currently are:  \n \n1. There are two major reasons I don't want to prioritize GIG more highly right now: (a) \nwe've taken a handful of bets on various incubation grants, and I'd like to see whether \nour hit rate is high enough to justify increased investment and (b) I'm optimistic that non -\nGIG efforts (i.e., intervention prioritization and continuing to solicit applications from the \nmost promising charities we can f ind) will create new top charities. Either factor could \nchange and that would cause me to reassess GIG's priority.  \n2. If we made a major error in our assessment of a charity or if we heard donors pushing \nback that we hadn't gone deep enough, I'd consider this . For now, my impression is that \nwe've historically gone deeper than necessary, and we're trying to tack in the other \ndirection.  \n3. For all research priorities where the goal is \"raise money\" rather than \"find the best \nopportunities possible,\" there are three  things that could affect prioritization: (a) we could \nmeet a major donor where the benefit of engagement is worth reprioritization (e.g., \nanother Good Ventures -sized donor would make me seriously consider changing \nresearch priorities), (b) we fail to rais e money through other approaches to outreach and \nusing our research capacity seems like the most promising path, or (c) we believe that \nour research capacity is unlikely to make meaningful progress on finding better giving \nopportunities so it's worth alloc ating it to the goal of increasing our money moved.  \n4. See above.  \n5. See above.  \n6. The above is true though, in this case, my instinct is that using research capacity is more \nlikely. Amanda Glassman at CGD thinks we should take this approach; conversations \nI've had  with DFID have often led to their asking us to provide follow up that utilizes \nresearch capacity (minimal to date).  \n7. This seems very unlikely. I'm skeptical we can do this well (i.e., complete shallow \ninvestigations that reach useful conclusions) and I'd b et that this wouldn't be useful to \nmany donor dollars based on our past experience with a GiveWell charities menu and \nwhat I've heard from donors over the years about what they value in our research. If I \nbelieved that a significant amount of funding truly  wanted this and I could see the path to \ndoing this successfully, I'd revisit.  \n8. Recent interactions with charities that we've reached out to implies that the M&E data \nmost charities have is similar to what they had in the 2009 -11 period, so this approach \nwouldn't likely yield more top charities. If charities came to us with compelling impact \nevaluation data, I'd change my mind.  \n9. We'd do this if the above didn't seem to be working.  \nDiscuss ways you would receive input required to change your perspective  \n● The pr iority of GIG will most likely change based on the success/failure of our past \ngrants and our ongoing success with finding new top charities in other ways. I expect \nthat we're going to have to let time pass to decide whether or not we should change its \nrelative priority.  \n\n \n ● Deciding to go deeper on charities would come in reaction to a problem. I feel good \nabout the level at which we're monitoring charities, and I could imagine discovering a \nproblem that causes us to want to invest more heavily in this priorit y. We speak to \ndonors regularly and we'd know if our major donors had concerns about the level of \ndepth/intensity of our reviews. So a change here would most likely be reactive to \nproblems or donor complaints.  \n○ The most likely ways we'd learn about problems  would be (a) our own ongoing \nfollow up identifies something we missed before, (b) donors ask us questions \nabout a charity that we can't answer but seem important; that, itself, might \nconvince us we made a mistake in not assessing a charity more deeply bef ore; \nit's also possible investigation driven by a donor's question causes us to find a \nproblem; or (c) some external reporting (media or academic research) informs us \nabout a problem.  \n● Re: 4 -6: we're in the process of developing our outreach strategy; we'r e also having \nconversations with people about how we might approach our project of influencing \nbilaterals. This is an active area of investigation where we're talking to people with varied \nexperience: fundraising, marketing, media, work with/in bilaterals and those \nconversations could change our prioritization of work within outreach. My preference is \nto focus on outreach efforts that don't require a major shift in our research, but if other \napproaches to outreach fail or if these seem like the most promisi ng approaches for \noutreach, we'd revisit.  \n● I'm not planning proactive steps to reassess 7 -9. \nOperations  \nName top 3 goals/metrics in operations  \n \n1. Maintain quality of our work across operations' key domains: donations processing, \nfinance & accounting, office management (including IT and reception), HR, legal, and \nwebsite.  \na. Metrics: Quantitative metrics are of limited value here, but they include things \nlike:  \ni. HR: are we completing all onboarding steps on a similar timeline / to \nsimilar degree as we were in 2016 ? \nii. Donations: the donations team has some specific quantitative metrics for \nthings like turnaround time to respond to donor questions.  \niii. IT: no significant internet downtime.  \niv. Websites: similar levels of downtime (very low) for maintenance; similar \nlag time on publishing content etc.  \n2. Build a team that has the appropriate capacity and expertise to maintain and improve \nour work across our domains while maintaining good work/life balance for all team \nmembers  \n\n \n a. Leverage operations staff: Similar to Elie’s first goa l, a key priority for me is to \nmaximize the long term impact of operations staff, especially my reports. I’m \nplanning to take a similar approach to Elie to accomplish this, and to measure \nsuccess at a high level by expanding the scope of what each person c an do \nwhile limiting the time I spend.  \nb. Hire new staff: In addition, we're actively recruiting a Controller, which will allow \nus to consolidate all finance & accounting work under one person and reduce the \nburden of that work on Sarah, other ops team member s (who we’d like to have \nfocus on other work), and Natalie (who still works on the budget, grant \nreconciliation, and metrics).  \ni. After we onboard the Controller, we plan to assess the team’s capacity \nand expertise to determine whether additional hiring is n ecessary.  \nc. Metrics:  \ni. Onboard Controller by September 2017?  \nii. Eliminate the need to rely on non -ops staff for ops work (possibly with one \nor two small exceptions, including research support management?) by \nearly 2018?  \niii. Maintain the quality of operations work a nd make significant progress on \nimprovements without ops staff working more than they can/want \nbetween now and mid -2018?  \n3. Implement significant improvements to operations and build for the future  \na. We plan to make improvements across all of the key ops domai ns, to varying \ndegrees. Short -term projects we plan to accomplish in H2 2017 are described in \nthe Operations H2 2017 Vision and Plan  [LINK REMOVED].  That plan also \nincludes lower priority projects that we plan to tackle in 2018 (or sooner, \ndepending on how  much progress we make in 2017).  \nb. Metrics: Vary from domain to domain. High level goals for each domain (roughly \nin order of priority; timeline to make significant progress varies depending on \npriority, but we’d like to accomplish the bulk of this work by the end of 2018):  \ni. Technical work: Address highest -priority technical problems, largely in \ndonations tech. This work overlaps with / is essential for improvements \nwe want to make in other domains.  \n1. Highest priority improvement project in this domain: impleme nt a \nbetter data integration system between our credit card processor \n(Braintree) and CRM (Salesforce) by early 2018.  \n2. We have some assessment work to do before we prioritize and \nstart the other potential projects we could do in this area. This is \non hold until we hire a Controller, because the staff member who \nwill be responsible for this is handling some finance work in the \ninterim. We plan to prioritize these projects by the end of 2017.  \nii. Finance & accounting: Reduce reliance on manual processes so that this \nwork takes staff less time and costs us less money relative to donation \nvolume (e.g., monthly close, grant reconciliation, updating the budget, \n\n \n audit). Improve and transition to different systems and processes so we’re \nequipped to scale as donors/dona tions grow.  \n1. Projects are detailed here [LINK REMOVED].  \niii. Donations processing: Improve systems and processes to reduce \nreliance on manual processes, reduce room for error, and maintain or \nimprove the donor experience as the number of donors and donations \ngrow. \n1. If we decide to switch to a new system for managing donor \ncommunications, implement new system before giving season \n2017 or, if that isn't possible due to other priorities and lack of in -\nhouse expertise, by mid -2018.  \n2. Other projects we plan to prioritiz e next are listed here [LINK \nREMOVED].  \niv. HR: Improve essential areas (essential = onboarding, offboarding, \nbenefits administration). E.g., onboarding needs to be streamlined and \nreviewed for things that we can make smoother for new staff. Improve \nareas outsi de of essential HR functions, including, e.g., offering staff more \nfrequent meetings with someone outside of their management chain.   \nv. Other tech: improve data security, separate GiveWell and Open Phil \nsystems, website improvements necessary for outreach w ork.  \nvi. Recruiting / retention: diversity & inclusion  \nvii. Legal / risk management: update miscellaneous outdated policies, \nimprove governance procedures, etc.  \n \nDiscuss why you believe in this relative priority (facts, experience, external input)  \nOperations is generally performing its essential functions without major problems, but it's not \nfunctioning optimally.  \n \nBuilding a team with appropriate capacity and expertise will allow us to continue maintaining ops \n(priority #1) and set us up to make i mprovements and build for the future (priority #2). This goal \nis also critical for retention – people will leave if we’re asking them to do too much on an \nongoing basis, and/or if we’re constantly asking people to perform tasks outside of their abilities \nand interests. We based the decision to hire a Controller on input from contacts at other \norganizations (Room to Read, Donors Choose, New Profit) and from our outsourced accounting \nfirm, BPM. We think several factors make this the right time to hire someone  with accounting \nexperience to lead this work: donations volume, number of payment platforms we use, our \ngrantmaking practices (numerous grants/year, including to international entities), increases in \nnumber of employee expenses and AP payments.  \n \nOnce we’ ve strengthened operations through a combination of goals 1 and 2, there are several \nareas within operations that could be improved. Whether or not it’s worth it to do all of the \nprojects we could depends partly on whether or not our donations volume grows  and we invest \nin outreach, because we could maintain things as they stand today without making many \n\n \n improvements. Some improvements are probably worthwhile either way (e.g., reducing some of \nour reliance on manual processes to save staff time and reduce r oom for error). Others won’t be \nnecessary if we don’t invest in outreach and/or start to see significant growth in the number of \ndonations we’re processing (e.g., website improvements related to SEO, additional donations \nprocessing improvements beyond the lowest hanging fruit).  \nDiscuss what it would take to change your perspective  \nI folded this into my previous answer. I could try to separate these out if that seems helpful.  \nDiscuss ways you would receive input required to change your perspective  \nI’m unsu re how to answer this in a way that's useful. Obviously, if the things I'm assuming above \ndon't play out as I expect, then I'd change my perspective, but that doesn't seem useful.  \nOutreach  \nName top 3 goals/metrics in Outreach  \n1. Increase our long -term (i.e., 5-10 years from now) money moved as much as possible  \n2. To accomplish this goal, set the plan/structure for our outreach work going forward: i.e., \nwhat approaches/segments should we focus on? How should we structure GiveWell to \nincrease the impact this work h as? \nMetrics  \n1. What is our average money moved 5 -10 years from now?  \n2. Do we have a compelling plan/strategy for outreach 12 months from now?  \nDiscuss why you believe in this relative priority (facts, experience, external input)  \n \nThis prioritization is aimed at i ncreasing our long -term money moved. I'm happy to discuss why I \nthink money moved is the right goal at the expense of other possible goals such as (a) \nmaximizing the number of donors who use our research or (b) trying to increase \nphilanthropy's/donors' foc us in general towards metrics and rigorous evaluation.  \nDiscuss what it would take to change your perspective  \nThis framework may not work well in this case since we're explicitly in a phase of exploration \nand assessment. We're actively trying to assess what  path we should take with outreach, so in \neach of our high -potential approaches we're talking to advisors/external parties that may be \nhelpful and trying to take opportunities to experiment with possibilities in the hopes of learning \nmore about the potenti al impacts of various types of work.  \n \n\n \n As part of developing this strategy, we'll have to figure out what sort of team/budget we want \noutreach to have. In addition to the possibility of fundraising to increase our budget, we have \nsignificant funding on hand  as a result of the split with Open Phil.  \nDiscuss ways you would receive the input to change your perspective  \n \nI'm actively talking to people aiming to clarify my perspective. I expect it will evolve substantially \nin the coming months.  \n \nConcretely:  \n● Aid Agencies - I've talked to people at USAID, DFID, CGD, Evidence Action, \nGiveDirectly, Michael Anderson (former head of CIFF), Ann Mei Cheng (former head of \nthe Lab at USAID), and staff/former staff of CHAI and GAVI  \n● Media - I talked to YCombinator and at the ir recommendation we hired Big Swing \nCommunications (the PR firm that works with YC companies).  \n● General marketing - have talked to YC, a donor of ours who works in management \nconsulting and the people who led growth at Quora and Dropbox.  \n● HNW donors - have not done very much of this yet. Have largely talked to Chuck \nSlaughter of Living Goods.  "

​that's​ ​l kely​ ​to​ ​be​ ​shared​ ​by​ ​the​ ​media​ ​that​ ​likely \nmatters​ ​most​ ​to​ ​us.​ ​Explicitly​ ​asking​ ​media​ ​for​ ​direct​ ​endorsements​ ​via​ ​Tweets​ ​or​ ​posts​ ​and​ ​making​ ​it​ ​easy​ ​for​ ​the​ ​folks​ ​we're \ntargeting​ ​to​ ​do​ ​so. \n\n\nhighly-aligned-media​ ​(e.g.,​ ​podcast​ ​our​ ​donors​ ​listen​ ​to)​ ​and​ ​we​ ​think​ ​they​ ​can​ ​repeat \nthat,​ ​we'll​ ​consider​ ​it​ ​a​ ​success.  3\n● Digital​ ​marketing \n○What​ ​is​ ​it?​​ ​Using​ ​online​ ​marketing​ ​(search​ ​engine​ ​optimization,​ ​Google​ ​AdWords, \npodcast​ ​ads)​ ​to​ ​reach​ ​new​ ​donors​ ​and​ ​our​ ​website​ ​as​ ​a​ ​crucial​ ​tool​ ​in​ ​raising​ ​more \nmoney. \n○What​ ​are​ ​we​ ​doing?​ ​​We've​ ​retained​ ​a​ ​digital​ ​marketing​ ​consultant​ ​who​ ​is​ ​focusing​ ​on​ ​(a) \nfixing​ ​our​ ​tracking​ ​and​ ​metrics,​ ​(b)​ ​improving​ ​our​ ​SEO,​ ​SEM​ ​and​ ​Facebook​ ​advertising, \n(c)​ ​working​ ​to​ ​optimize​ ​our​ ​site​ ​for​ ​donations,​ ​and​ ​(d)​ ​trying​ ​to​ ​create​ ​a​ ​better​ ​experience \nfor​ ​larger​ ​donors​ ​who​ ​land​ ​on​ ​our​ ​website​ ​hoping​ ​to​ ​learn​ ​more​ ​about​ ​our​ ​work​ ​but​ ​not \nyet​ ​ready​ ​to​ ​give. \n○Current​ ​thinking​:​ ​My​ ​instinct​ ​is​ ​that​ ​the​ ​most​ ​important​ ​piece​ ​of​ ​this​ ​work​ ​is​ ​(d):​ ​it \nfocuses​ ​on​ ​larger​ ​donors​ ​and​ ​they're​ ​the​ ​ones​ ​who​ ​make​ ​up​ ​80%​ ​of​ ​the​ ​money​ ​we​ ​move. \nI​ ​largely​ ​see​ ​working​ ​with​ ​the​ ​consultant​ ​as​ ​an​ ​experiment​ ​in​ ​helping​ ​us​ ​learn​ ​more​ ​about \nwhether​ ​he's​ ​the​ ​sort​ ​of​ ​person​ ​who​ ​could​ ​really​ ​help​ ​us​ ​with​ ​(d)​ ​long-term.​ ​A​ ​fringe \nbenefit​ ​is​ ​that​ ​it​ ​may​ ​drive​ ​some​ ​more​ ​smaller​ ​donors​ ​and​ ​improve​ ​our​ ​tracking. \n○How​ ​will​ ​we​ ​measure​ ​success?​​ ​By​ ​December​ ​31,​ ​2017,​ ​we​ ​should​ ​have​ ​the​ ​below; \nthese​ ​are​ ​fairly​ ​subjective,​ ​but​ ​we'll​ ​assess​ ​their​ ​value​ ​(especially​ ​the​ ​increase​ ​in​ ​dollars \ndonated)​ ​against​ ​the​ ​cost​ ​of​ ​the​ ​consultant. \n■ Cost:​ ​. \n■ Process​ ​improvements: \n■ High-quality​ ​tracking​ ​of​ ​donors​ ​through​ ​our​ ​website,​ ​so​ ​we​ ​should​ ​be \nable​ ​to​ ​directly​ ​connect​ ​donors​ ​to​ ​visits​ ​to​ ​the​ ​website​ ​and​ ​measure​ ​the \nimpact​ ​of​ ​different​ ​channels​ ​(i.e.,​ ​SEO,​ ​SEM,​ ​specific​ ​referral​ ​links). \n■ Progress​ ​towards​ ​a​ ​flow​ ​donors​ ​who​ ​aren't​ ​ready​ ​to​ ​give​ ​but​ ​want​ ​to \nlearn​ ​more​ ​which​ ​allows​ ​us​ ​to​ ​track​ ​and​ ​follow​ ​up​ ​with​ ​them. \n■ Directly​ ​translatable​ ​into​ ​money​ ​moved: \n■ Increase​ ​in​ ​the​ ​number​ ​of​ ​donors​ ​who​ ​come​ ​to​ ​our​ ​site​ ​vis​ ​SEO,​ ​SEM \nand​ ​advertising​ ​due​ ​to​ ​the​ ​consultant's​ ​work. \n■ Increase​ ​in​ ​the​ ​conversion​ ​rate​ ​of​ ​donors​ ​who​ ​come​ ​to​ ​our​ ​site. \n● Fundraising \n○What​ ​is​ ​it?​​ ​A​ ​broad​ ​category​ ​meant​ ​to​ ​include​ ​standard​ ​approaches​ ​non-profits​ ​take​ ​to \nraise​ ​money​ ​which​ ​you​ ​should​ ​associate​ ​with​ ​\"build​ ​a​ ​fundraising​ ​department.\"​ ​This \nincludes: \n■ Corporate​ ​and​ ​foundation​ ​solicitation \n■ Building​ ​a​ ​pipeline​ ​of​ ​individual​ ​donors​ ​to​ ​solicit​ ​from \n■ Building​ ​a​ ​program​ ​to​ ​segment​ ​and​ ​raise​ ​more​ ​from​ ​existing,​ ​smaller​ ​donors. \n○What​ ​are​ ​we​ ​doing?​ ​​Largely​ ​exploring/thinking​ ​but​ ​it's​ ​the​ ​next​ ​most​ ​pressing​ ​priority​ ​to \nget​ ​started​ ​with.​ ​Brigid​ ​has​ ​been​ ​really​ ​helpful​ ​here;​ ​I've​ ​also​ ​talked​ ​to​ ​Erin​ ​Ganju​ ​the \nCEO​ ​of​ ​Room​ ​to​ ​Read​ ​about​ ​their​ ​work.​ ​(Room​ ​to​ ​Read​ ​is​ ​one​ ​of​ ​the​ ​more​ ​successful \nstories​ ​of​ ​the​ ​last​ ​decade​ ​of​ ​fundraising​ ​for​ ​international​ ​aid.) \n○Current​ ​thinking​:​ ​this​ ​seems​ ​promising​ ​because​ ​it's​ ​the​ ​standard​ ​approach​ ​nonprofits \ntake.​ ​It​ ​seems​ ​pretty​ ​likely​ ​that​ ​making​ ​progress​ ​on​ ​this​ ​is​ ​going​ ​to​ ​be​ ​the​ ​right​ ​next​ ​step. \nThat'll​ ​most​ ​likely​ ​mean​ ​me​ ​doing​ ​some​ ​work​ ​with​ ​some​ ​support​ ​to​ ​decide​ ​whether​ ​or​ ​not \nwe​ ​should​ ​try​ ​to​ ​hire​ ​someone. \n3 Cost:  \n. \n\n\n○ How ​  ​ will ​  ​ we ​  ​ measure ​  ​ success? ​ ​  ​ TBD ​  ​ for ​  ​ now ​  ​ since ​  ​ we ​  ​ haven't ​  ​ started ​  ​ our ​  ​ work.  \n ● Direct ​  ​ outreach ​  ​ to ​  ​ HNW ​  ​ donors  \n ○ What ​  ​ is ​  ​ it? ​  ​​ Because ​  ​ we ​  ​ expect ​  ​ that ​  ​ our ​  ​ outreach ​  ​ success ​  ​ will ​  ​ be ​  ​ determined ​  ​ by ​  ​ the  \n donations ​  ​ of ​  ​ a ​  ​ relatively ​  ​ small ​  ​ number ​  ​ of ​  ​ donors, ​  ​ it's ​  ​ possible ​  ​ that ​  ​ our ​  ​ optimal ​  ​ strategy ​  ​ will  \n be ​  ​ directly ​  ​ targeting ​  ​ donors ​  ​ who ​  ​ may ​  ​ give ​  ​ very ​  ​ large ​  ​ donations ​  ​ ($100k+).  \n ○ What ​  ​ are ​  ​ we ​  ​ doing? ​  ​​ I'm ​  ​ currently ​  ​ trying ​  ​ to ​  ​ have ​  ​ 20 ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ to ​  ​ get ​  ​ a ​  ​ better ​  ​ sense ​  ​ of ​  ​ the  \n costs, ​  ​ benefits, ​  ​ and ​  ​ expected ​  ​ value ​  ​ of ​  ​ this ​  ​ activity. ​  ​ I've ​  ​ scheduled ​  ​ ~5.  \n ○ Current ​  ​ thinking? ​ ​  ​ Very ​  ​ roughly, ​  ​ Holden ​  ​ and ​  ​ I ​  ​ have ​  ​ had ​  ​ 10-20 ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ like ​  ​ this ​  ​ in ​  ​ the  \n past, ​  ​ and ​  ​ I ​  ​ don't ​  ​ believe ​  ​ that ​  ​ any ​  ​ resulted ​  ​ in ​  ​ donations, ​  ​ but ​  ​ it's ​  ​ possible ​  ​ that ​  ​ changes ​  ​ to  \n (a) ​  ​ the ​  ​ GiveWell ​  ​ product ​  ​ since ​  ​ we ​  ​ had ​  ​ those ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ (2008-2012), ​  ​ (b) ​  ​ changes ​  ​ to ​  ​ the  \n pitch, ​  ​ or ​  ​ (c) ​  ​ changes ​  ​ to ​  ​ the ​  ​ process ​  ​ could ​  ​ yield ​  ​ a ​  ​ better ​  ​ hit ​  ​ rate.  4\n ○ How ​  ​ will ​  ​ we ​  ​ measure ​  ​ success? ​ ​  ​ Return ​  ​ and ​  ​ time ​  ​ cost ​  ​ of ​  ​ first ​  ​ round ​  ​ of ​  ​ meetings.   \n ● Outreach ​  ​ to ​  ​ government ​  ​ aid ​  ​ agencies  \n ○ What ​  ​ is ​  ​ it? ​ ​  ​ Government ​  ​ aid ​  ​ agencies ​  ​ give ​  ​ a ​  ​ huge ​  ​ amount ​  ​ of ​  ​ money ​  ​ (tens ​  ​ of ​  ​ billions ​  ​ of  \n dollars) ​  ​ so ​  ​ they're ​  ​ one ​  ​ of ​  ​ the ​  ​ best ​  ​ targets ​  ​ if ​  ​ we're ​  ​ trying ​  ​ to ​  ​ increase ​  ​ our ​  ​ money ​  ​ moved.  \n ○ What ​  ​ are ​  ​ we ​  ​ doing? ​  ​​ Trying ​  ​ to ​  ​ have ​  ​ conversations ​  ​ with ​  ​ people ​  ​ in ​  ​ the ​  ​ agencies ​  ​ and  \n others ​  ​ who ​  ​ know ​  ​ them ​  ​ well ​  ​ to ​  ​ get ​  ​ a ​  ​ sense ​  ​ of ​  ​ our ​  ​ prospects. ​  ​ We ​  ​ have ​  ​ a ​  ​ strong ​  ​ ally ​  ​ in ​  ​ the  \n UK's ​  ​ DFID ​  ​ who ​  ​ comes ​  ​ out ​  ​ of ​  ​ the ​  ​ effective ​  ​ altruism ​  ​ community ​  ​ and ​  ​ wants ​  ​ to ​  ​ help;  \n otherwise, ​  ​ I'm ​  ​ trying ​  ​ to ​  ​ keep ​  ​ my ​  ​ ear ​  ​ to ​  ​ the ​  ​ ground ​  ​ and ​  ​ have ​  ​ conversations ​  ​ as ​  ​ they ​  ​ come  \n up.  \n ○ Current ​  ​ status: ​  ​​ Largely ​  ​ slow ​  ​ burn ​  ​ and ​  ​ opportunistic ​  ​ beyond ​  ​ the ​  ​ contact ​  ​ at ​  ​ DFID. ​  ​ Key  \n next ​  ​ steps ​  ​ we ​  ​ may ​  ​ pursue ​  ​ boil ​  ​ down ​  ​ to ​  ​ allocating ​  ​ some ​  ​ research ​  ​ capacity ​  ​ to ​  ​ (a)  \n understand ​  ​ how ​  ​ major ​  ​ aid ​  ​ agencies ​  ​ work ​  ​ (how ​  ​ do ​  ​ they ​  ​ make ​  ​ decisions, ​  ​ where ​  ​ we ​  ​ might  \n we ​  ​ best ​  ​ fit ​  ​ in) ​  ​ and ​  ​ (b) ​  ​ understanding ​  ​ some ​  ​ of ​  ​ the ​  ​ smaller ​  ​ aid ​  ​ agencies ​  ​ (e.g., ​  ​ Norway,  \n Sweden) ​  ​ which ​  ​ are ​  ​ still ​  ​ very ​  ​ large ​  ​ donors.  \n ● Outreach ​  ​ to ​  ​ foundations  \n ○ Definitions ​ : ​  ​ Distinguish ​  ​ between ​  ​ two ​  ​ types ​  ​ of ​  ​ foundations: ​  ​ staffed ​  ​ and ​  ​ unstaffed. ​  ​ I ​  ​ think  \n unstaffed ​  ​ foundations ​  ​ are ​  ​ similar ​  ​ to ​  ​ HNW ​  ​ individuals ​  ​ and ​  ​ don't ​  ​ think ​  ​ there's ​  ​ a ​  ​ particular  \n strategy ​  ​ we ​  ​ should ​  ​ take ​  ​ that's ​  ​ different.  \n ○ Current ​  ​ status:  \n ■ Unstaffed: ​  ​ I ​  ​ think ​  ​ it ​  ​ largely ​  ​ makes ​  ​ sense ​  ​ to ​  ​ approach ​  ​ unstaffed ​  ​ foundations ​  ​ like  \n HNW ​  ​ donors. ​  ​ I'd ​  ​ include ​  ​ these ​  ​ in ​  ​ the ​  ​ HNW ​  ​ donor ​  ​ bucket ​  ​ above. ​  ​ We ​  ​ have  \n GiveWell ​  ​ top ​  ​ charities ​  ​ donors ​  ​ that ​  ​ are ​  ​ from ​  ​ unstaffed ​  ​ foundations ​  ​ and ​  ​ they ​  ​ seem  \n to ​  ​ operate ​  ​ like ​  ​ HNW ​  ​ individual ​  ​ donors ​  ​ do.  \n ■ Staffed: ​  ​ I ​  ​ don't ​  ​ think ​  ​ we're ​  ​ likely ​  ​ to ​  ​ convince ​  ​ staffed ​  ​ foundations ​  ​ (e.g., ​  ​ Hewlett,  \n Gates) ​  ​ to ​  ​ use ​  ​ our ​  ​ research. ​  ​ Instead, ​  ​ I've ​  ​ tried ​  ​ to ​  ​ build ​  ​ relationships ​  ​ with  \n like-minded ​  ​ funders ​  ​ that ​  ​ might ​  ​ \"co-fund\" ​  ​ opportunities ​  ​ with ​  ​ us ​  ​ that ​  ​ meet ​  ​ their  \n needs. ​  ​ Aligned ​  ​ funders ​  ​ include: ​  ​ ELMA ​  ​ Philanthropies, ​  ​ Global ​  ​ Innovation ​  ​ Fund,  \n IKEA ​  ​ Foundation, ​  ​ Lampert ​  ​ Family ​  ​ Foundation.   \n ○ Next ​  ​ steps? ​ ​  ​ I ​  ​ don't ​  ​ currently ​  ​ have ​  ​ great ​  ​ ideas ​  ​ for ​  ​ next ​  ​ steps ​  ​ here ​  ​ beyond ​  ​ building  \n existing ​  ​ relationships ​  ​ and ​  ​ looking ​  ​ out ​  ​ for ​  ​ more.  \n 4 ​  ​ It's ​  ​ also ​  ​ possible ​  ​ that ​  ​ we'll ​  ​ have ​  ​ a ​  ​ ~5% ​  ​ yield ​  ​ on ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ and ​  ​ if ​  ​ successful ​  ​ conversations ​  ​ average ​  ​ $500k/year, ​  ​ this ​  ​ could ​  ​ be ​  ​ a  \n scalable ​  ​ strategy ​  ​ would ​  ​ take ​  ​ ~750 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ / ​  ​ year ​  ​ for ​  ​ 200 ​  ​ donor ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ / ​  ​ year ​  ​ with ​  ​ expected ​  ​ yield ​  ​ of ​  ​ $5m. ​  ​ 750 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ assumes ​  ​ that  \n 75% ​  ​ of ​  ​ the ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ (150) ​  ​ take ​  ​ 2 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ each, ​  ​ 15% ​  ​ (30 ​  ​ meetings) ​  ​ take ​  ​ 5 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ each, ​  ​ and ​  ​ 10% ​  ​ of ​  ​ the ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ take ​  ​ 10 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ each  \n (20 ​  ​ meetings) ​  ​ = ​  ​ 300 ​  ​ + ​  ​ 150 ​  ​ + ​  ​ 200 ​  ​ = ​  ​ 650. ​  ​ Then, ​  ​ add ​  ​ 100 ​  ​ for ​  ​ general ​  ​ overhead/buffer. ​  ​ 750 ​  ​ hours ​  ​ of ​  ​ project ​  ​ work ​  ​ is ​  ​ roughly ​  ​ 50% ​  ​ of ​  ​ a  \n full-time ​  ​ staffer. ​  ​ On ​  ​ the ​  ​ other ​  ​ hand, ​  ​ if ​  ​ meetings ​  ​ take ​  ​ longer ​  ​ or ​  ​ the ​  ​ yield ​  ​ (dollar ​  ​ value ​  ​ or ​  ​ odds ​  ​ of ​  ​ success) ​  ​ is ​  ​ lower, ​  ​ it ​  ​ might ​  ​ not ​  ​ be  \n worth ​  ​ the ​  ​ effort ​  ​ to ​  ​ invest ​  ​ in ​  ​ this.  \n  \n  \n\n● Focus ​  ​ on ​  ​ research  \n ○ What ​  ​ is ​  ​ it? ​  ​​ Focus ​  ​ on ​  ​ research ​  ​ that ​  ​ helps ​  ​ build ​  ​ out ​  ​ answers ​  ​ to ​  ​ questions ​  ​ donors ​  ​ have.  \n For ​  ​ example, ​  ​ this ​  ​ might ​  ​ mean ​  ​ more ​  ​ focus ​  ​ on ​  ​ research ​  ​ useful ​  ​ in ​  ​ response ​  ​ to ​  ​ disasters ​  ​ or  \n more ​  ​ actively ​  ​ doing ​  ​ GiveWell ​  ​ Incubation ​  ​ Grant ​  ​ work ​  ​ in ​  ​ causes ​  ​ (education, ​  ​ surgery)  \n where ​  ​ our ​  ​ learning ​  ​ more ​  ​ about ​  ​ them ​  ​ would ​  ​ give ​  ​ us ​  ​ better ​  ​ answers ​  ​ for ​  ​ donors ​  ​ about ​  ​ our  \n views.  \n ○ What ​  ​ are ​  ​ we ​  ​ doing? ​  ​​ Nothing ​  ​ right ​  ​ now. ​  ​ There's ​  ​ a ​  ​ sharp ​  ​ line ​  ​ between ​  ​ research ​  ​ and  \n outreach. ​  ​ Research ​  ​ makes ​  ​ decisions ​  ​ based ​  ​ on ​  ​ trying ​  ​ to ​  ​ find ​  ​ the ​  ​ highest-return ​  ​ charities  \n and ​  ​ outreach ​  ​ tries ​  ​ to ​  ​ increase ​  ​ money ​  ​ moved ​  ​ as ​  ​ much ​  ​ as ​  ​ possible.  \n ○ Next ​  ​ steps? ​ ​  ​ I ​  ​ think ​  ​ this ​  ​ is ​  ​ worth ​  ​ doing ​  ​ but ​  ​ we ​  ​ don't ​  ​ have ​  ​ capacity ​  ​ for ​  ​ it ​  ​ now ​  ​ without  \n trading ​  ​ off ​  ​ on ​  ​ research ​  ​ and ​  ​ I ​  ​ want ​  ​ to ​  ​ give ​  ​ more ​  ​ standard ​  ​ outreach ​  ​ approaches ​  ​ a ​  ​ shot. ​  ​ A  \n major ​  ​ focus ​  ​ in ​  ​ our ​  ​ low-burn ​  ​ (job ​  ​ posting ​  ​ on ​  ​ our ​  ​ website) ​  ​ recruiting ​  ​ efforts ​  ​ is ​  ​ finding ​  ​ the  \n sort ​  ​ of ​  ​ person ​  ​ who ​  ​ could ​  ​ do ​  ​ this: ​  ​ i.e., ​  ​ a ​  ​ really ​  ​ strong ​  ​ researcher.  \n ● Other  \n ○ Improving ​  ​ metrics: ​  ​ our ​  ​ metrics ​  ​ are ​  ​ suboptimal ​  ​ in ​  ​ that ​  ​ they ​  ​ miss ​  ​ some ​  ​ money ​  ​ moved. ​  ​ Our  \n best ​  ​ guess ​  ​ is ​  ​ that ​  ​ we ​  ​ don't ​  ​ track ​  ​ ~25% ​  ​ ($10 ​  ​ million) ​  ​ of ​  ​ our ​  ​ non-Good ​  ​ Ventures ​  ​ money  \n moved. ​  ​ We're ​  ​ not ​  ​ sure ​  ​ how ​  ​ to ​  ​ fix ​  ​ this ​  ​ beyond ​  ​ making ​  ​ a ​  ​ push ​  ​ to ​  ​ get ​  ​ more ​  ​ donors ​  ​ to ​  ​ give  \n through ​  ​ us. ​  ​ What ​  ​ we ​  ​ call ​  ​ \"stewardship.\" ​  ​ This ​  ​ seems ​  ​ like ​  ​ a ​  ​ worthwhile ​  ​ thing ​  ​ to ​  ​ do.  \n  "

This policy is intended to ensure that donors to GiveWell need not worry\nabout our room for more funding: when we have more than we can productively use\nourselves, the result is more grants to the best charities we've found.\nWe seek to hold a reasonable level of assets: one that gives us a stable, predictable\nﬁnancial situation and the ability to plan and to take any outstanding opportunities\nthat come up (particularly with regard to hiring). Assets beyond what we feel we need\nin order to accomplish this are granted out. Details follow.\nDetails of the \"excess assets\" policy\nUnrestricted assets are the assets controlled by GiveWell that are available for\noperating expenses (this excludes assets held in our donor-advised fund as well as all\nassets restricted by donors in such a way that we can't use them for operating\nexpenses).GiveWell's \"excess assets\" policy »  »  » GIVEWELL'S \"EXCESS ASSETS\" POLICY HOME ABOUT OFFICIAL RECORDS\nGIVING EFFECTIVELY HOW WE WORK TOP CHARITIES RESEARCH OUR MISTAKES\nABOUT UPDATES\n\n10/18/2017 GiveW ell's \"excess assets\" policy | GiveW ell\nhttps://www .givewell.org/about/of ficial-records/Excess-Assets-Policy 2/3\"Months' worth of unrestricted assets\" refers to how many months we could operate,\naccording to current (generally conservative) expense projections, if revenue were to\ncease entirely.\nWe seek to be in a ﬁnancial position such that our cash ﬂow projections show us\nhaving 12 months' worth of unrestricted assets in each of the next 12 months. A couple\nof simpliﬁed examples to illustrate this idea:\n\"Excess assets\" are deﬁned as unrestricted assets in excess of what is needed to fulﬁl\nthe above criterion.\nAt each Board meeting at which we approve a budget (of which we have at least one\nper year), we assess the level of our \"excess assets\" and, if we have any, to irrevocably\nearmark them for regranting (the timing and nature of the grants will be at our\ndiscretion, but the grants cannot be made to GiveWell or an aﬃliated organization).\nUnrestricted assets arising from an extraordinary transaction, such as a sale of assets,\nmay be considered up to one year following the closing of such transaction, rather\nthan at the next Board meeting at which we approve a budget.If we had projected expenses of $30,000 per month (constant), and projected no\nnew revenue in the next 12 months, we would need $720,000 of unrestricted assets\nin order to fulﬁl the above criterion (in this case, we would be projecting\n$360,000.00 in unrestricted assets - just enough for 12 months - 12 months from\nnow).\nIf we had projected expenses of $30,000 per month (constant) and expected\n$500,000 of revenue to come in all at once six months from now, we would need\n$510,000 of unrestricted assets in order to fulﬁl the above criterion (in this case, we\nwould be projecting $360,000 in unrestricted assets - just enough for 12 months -\nﬁve months from now).\n\n10/18/2017 GiveW ell's \"excess assets\" policy | GiveW ell\nhttps://www .givewell.org/about/of ficial-records/Excess-Assets-Policy 3/3      HOME CONTACT STAY UPDATED FAQ FOR CHARITIES SITE MAP\nOPEN PHILANTHROPY PROJECT\nFOLLOW US:\n  EMAIL ADDRESS S U B M I TSUBSCRIBE TO EMAIL UPDATES:\nGiveWell, aka The Clear Fund (a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) public charity).

          "text": " \n What are GiveWell's major priorities over the next 3 -5 years?  \n \nThis document lists our major priorities by functional area: research, operations, and outreach.  \n \nResearch  \n \nThe success GiveWell has had to date has been due to the quality of our research, so the items \nbelow are crucial to our continued success.  \n \n1. Maintain and improve our product . Among other things, this means that we will continue to \n(a) update our views on ou r current top charities, (b) look for and find new top charities and \ninterventions, (c) revise and improve our cost -effectiveness analysis, (d) through GiveWell \nIncubation Grants, continue to identify opportunities to generate more top charity contenders \nby funding research, start -up charities and improved monitoring all while maintaining the \nsame level of transparency that we have to date.  \na. As part of maintaining the quality of GiveWell's recommendations, we plan to formally \nrevisit the focus on global hea lth and development (GH&D). GiveWell chose to focus \non GH&D because our early research (2007 -2010) convinced us that GH&D offered \nthe best giving opportunities that met our criteria. However, at its core, GiveWell is \nnot focused on GH&D; we're focused on t he best giving opportunities that are \nevidence -backed, cost -effective and have room for more funding. While our \nexpectation is that revisiting this decision will lead us to maintain our focus on GH&D, \nwe plan to revisit this decision. The points below assu me that we continue to focus \non GH&D.  \n2. Comprehensively survey program areas in GH&D and have compelling answers for \nwhy we recommend the programs we do, and why we don't recommend others.  \nGiveWell has looked at many programs, but there remain many that we h aven't examined in \ndepth. For example, we would like to have a more systematic view of education, agriculture, \nreproductive health, and surgical interventions. There are also more general areas we \nhaven't formally evaluated such as health systems strengthe ning and disease elimination or \neradication programs. We plan to do research that allows us to assess these programs and \neither make them priority programs (and seek out charities that implement them) or formally \nexplain why we do not believe they are prom ising.  \na. This may also include approaches to GH&D that go beyond direct program delivery. \nFor example, philanthropy that aims to improve tobacco or road safety regulations \nglobally to improve health and reduce disability. As has been the case, such \nprograms would need to be evidence -backed, cost -effective, and scalable to be \npriority programs.  \n3. All charities that should be top charities are top charities . Currently, we may not \nrecommend some charities for reasons including (a) they misunderstand us, our value -\nadded, or our process so they don't apply, (b) we haven't completed the work to assess the \nevidence for the intervention they implement (see the bullet above), or (c) we have limited \ncapacity and have prioritized our work such that we haven't yet been able  to review some \npromising organizations. GiveWell should eventually overcome this hurdle and should be \nconfident that all charities that exist that would meet our criteria are recommended.  \n\n \n 4. GiveWell has created the mechanism and incentive for people to star t organizations \nthat could meet our criteria.  Taken together, we believe that the work laid out above will \ncreate the incentive for people to try to create high -impact nonprofits that meet our criteria \nbecause we can offer (a) financial support to people w ho want to start an organization, \nconduct early stage research or add M&E to a program they're already running through the \nGiveWell Incubation Grants program, (b) predictable criteria to determine whether or not an \norganization will be recommended, and (c)  significant funding if the organization succeeds.  \n \nThis is important because other than GiveWell we believe that these incentives are not \nnearly strong enough. GiveWell is uniquely positioned because we can offer both early stage \nfinancial support but al so significant funding to groups at scale. We believe that creating a \nstrong incentive for people to create high -impact organizations is a way through which we \ncould have significant long -term impact beyond the funding we move directly to our \nrecommendatio ns. \n \n \nOutreach  \n \nWe have historically put limited time into proactive outreach and have consistently treated \nresearch as a higher organizational priority. Given the quality of our research, we now believe \nthat outreach is at a similar priority level to rese arch and we anticipate allocating significant \ncapacity to it in the future.  \n \n1. We aim to significantly increase our money moved . Specifically, our non -Good Ventures \nmoney moved is currently approximately $40 million annually. We aim to increase that figure \nto $100 million annually. We do not have specific goals for whether this comes from one (or \nrelatively few) major donor(s) or a large number of smaller donors: our focus is on the \namount of funding we direct.  \na. In 2016, Good Ventures gave approximately $60 million to our recommendations \n($50 million to top charities and $10 million to GiveWell Incubation Grants). We \nexpect this funding to continue.  \n \nOperations / organizational goals  \n \nBefore mid -2016, we treated o perations as a low priority, and we have a lot of work to do to improve \nit. It is important that we get to a situation where:  \n \n1. GiveWell has high -quality operations . Our operations infrastructure, including our work in \ndonations processing, finance, legal, HR, tech, and office management, is high -quality and \ncan support our research and outreach goals.   \n2. GiveWell is a robust organization whose success does not rely on any one individual. \nFor all staff members, we have a contingency plan and ability to thrive  if we lose any \nindividual.  "

          "text": "GiveWell Financial Summary \nMeeting of the GiveWell Board of Directors –  June 18, 2018 \n\nAgenda \n1.Overview of board votes \n2.Looking back: Expenses and revenues in 2017 \na. For review and discussion only \n3.Looking forward: Expense and revenue projections 2018-2020 \na. Board decisions – more detail \nb. Our approach \nc. Budget proposal \nd. Revenue projections \n4.Board decisions – discussion and votes \n\nSummary of board votes \n1.Vote to approve 2018 and 2019 budgets \na. The 2018 budget was approved last year. We are requesting an increase in that budget of $0.7 \nmillion. \nb. The 2019 budget represents a $2.2 million increase over 2018. \n2.Vote to restrict unrestricted assets as restricted to grants to recommended \ncharities \na. Restrict a portion of an individual's donation so that their contribution does not exceed 20% of our \nexpected operating budget. \nb. Restrict a portion of our unrestricted assets in accordance with our excess assets policy. \n\nLooking back: 2017 summary \n●We spent very slightly less than we \nbudgeted in 2017 (-0.2%). \n○ Open Phil expenses are included through May. \n○ We spent 11% less than budgeted in the 2nd \nhalf of 2017 (after the Open Phil/GiveWell \nsplit). \n●Higher revenue in 2017 than expected, \nplus two large payments from Good \nVentures related to Open Phil separation. \n\n\nExpense projections vs. actuals for 2017 \n\n\nRevenue projections vs. actuals for 2017 \nIn addition, we received: \n● $2.45 million from Good \nVentures/Open Philanthropy \nProject to cover costs of \noperating the Open \nPhilanthropy Project from \nOctober 2016 to May 2017. \nReceived in 2018. \n● $2.65 million from Good \nVentures/Open Philanthropy \nProject for the sale of assets \nto the Open Philanthropy \nProject LLC. \n48% of total, \n69 donors \n24% of total, \n>4k donors \n14% of total, \n1 donor 14% of total, \n1 donor \n\nLooking forward: revenue projections and spending proposal \n●We propose planning for significant growth in spending, driven by hiring \n(primarily in outreach but some in research) from ~$5m year in 2018 to ~9m/year \nin 2020. \n○ We project that our revenues will continue to keep pace with such a growth in expenses over the \nnext two years. \n●Our asset level is high. Based on conservative revenue projections and the \nproposed spending plan, we recommend granting out ~$1.75m in unrestricted \nfunds per excess assets policy. \n\n\nItems for board vote – more detail \n1. Approval of budget: \nVote on revised 2018 budget and 2019 budgets. Note that we will propose an update to the 2019 budget in early to mid 2019. \n2. Application of 20% cap on single revenue source: \nOne individual gave a unrestricted donation that exceeds 20% of our 2018 operating budget. To action the rule of not \nsupporting more than 20% of our operations from a single revenue source, we are proposing a vote to irrevocably designate a \nportion of this donation as restricted for grants to recommended charities. \n3. Application of \"Excess Assets\" policy : \nGiveWell has an \"excess assets\" policy, specifying that once we surpass a certain level of unrestricted assets, we grant out the \nexcess rather than continue to hold it ourselves. We estimate that our current asset level is above the level specified in the \npolicy and that the board should irrevocably designate a potion of unrestricted assets as restricted for grants to recommended \ncharities. \n\nBudget for 2018-2020 – approach \n●Be conservative: Set the budget to minimize (<5% chance) the chance that we \nidentify a high-impact opportunity to spend funds but don't have funds available \nto take advantage of that opportunity. \n○ Budgeting for major growth in staff, across all three areas of the organization (operations, outreach, \nand research) in both entry-level and senior positions, as well as for significant growth in \nadvertising, outreach consultants, and staff recruitment. \n●Budget for current staff compensation with annual increases, projected hires, and \nother expense categories based on experience and anticipated changes. Add 10% \nof non-staff total for unexpected expenses. \n\nProposed budget for 2018-2020 \n* 2017 total is H2 amount doubled, because H1 includes \nOpen Philanthropy costs and is not comparable to \n2018-2020 \n\nBudget for 2018-2020 \n* 2018 amount is compared to doubled amount from H2 2017 \n\n\nChanges to 2018 budget since mid-2017 \nNotes: \n● Budget increase of $750k. \n● Increase driven by \nadvertising (+$225k), \naddition of buffer (+$200k), \nstaff recruitment (+$140k), \naccounting fees (+$85k) and \ntravel (+$75k). \n\nRevenue projections for 2018-2020 – approach \nCategory Projected growth rate – best guess Projected growth \nrate – \nconservative Comments \nGood Ventures Set at 20% of operating expenses Same \nPrivate individual Set at 20% of operating expenses Same Unlikely to exceed ~$2 million/year \nOther major institutions No growth No growth \nOther $100,000+ donors 0%\n0% No sustained recent growth in this group \nDonors giving $10,000 - $99,999 10% 0% Amount from this group has been quite variable but growth in \nnumber of donors suggests this category will at least been \nmaintained and likely grow modestly. \nDonors giving $1,000 - $9,999 10% 0% Same as above. \nDonors giving $100 - $999 36% in 2018, then 10% per year 0% Have seen sustained growth from this group. \nDonors giving under $100 50% in 2018, then 10% per year 0% Have seen high, sustained growth from this group. \nAnonymous donors 0% 0% Donations received without designations and without donor \ncontact information are recorded as unrestricted. \n\nExcess assets test \n●Using the proposed budget and conservative revenue projection indicates that, according to the \nExcess Assets policy, the board should vote to designate $1.75 million in unrestricted assets as \nrestricted to grants to recommended charities. \n●Using the proposed budget and best guess revenue projection, we project that, if we make the  \nproposed excess assets grant, we will continue to have at least 12-months of reserves available \nuntil late 2020. In other words, we expect to have ample time to make adjustments (e.g. \nincrease fundraising efforts, reduce spending growth) as of the next planned board review in \nmid-2019. \n\n\nExcess assets test \n\n\nItems for board vote \n1. Approval of budget: \nVote on revised 2018 budget and 2019 budgets. Note that 2019 budget will likely be updated in early to mid 2019. \nWith the approval of this budget, GiveWell will request a grant from Good Ventures of 20% of 2018 operating expenses, less \nthe estimate of rent replacement value: $751,179. \n2. Application of 20% cap on single revenue source: \nVote on proposal to irrevocably designate $1,121,005 of the $2,100,000 unrestricted donation from a private individual as \nrestricted for grants to recommended charities. $1,121,005 is the difference between $2,100,000 and 20% of our budgeted \noperating costs for 2018 ($978,995). \n3. Application of \"Excess Assets\" policy: \nVote on proposal to irrevocably designate $1,751,256 of unrestricted assets as restricted to grants to recommended charities. \n"

          "text": "Executive compensation review  This document includes three categories of comparables for executive compensation at GiveWell, and a proposal for raising the salary of Elie Hassenfeld, GiveWell's Executive Director:  ● Foundations: Private data drawn from a compensation survey of 131 foundations (2016 data)  ● Research not--for--profits: Public data from the 990s of nine not-for-profit organizations conducting research and charity evaluation (2016 data)  ● Academics: Economics professors at the University of California, Berkeley (2016 data). ● Open Philanthropy Project: Open Philanthropy Project compensation information.  Compensation proposal: Elie proposes raising his annual salary from $200,000 to $250,000.   Foundations   Note that we did not update this data for 2018. Below, we use the same data we showed last year: 2016 compensation data for foundations.  We have private data from a 2016 survey of 131 foundations by Lasnik--Broida Consultants, Inc. in collaboration with The Croner Company. Below is aggregate information about total compensation for CEOs among foundations with 16-50 employees.  CEO Compensation at Foundations with 16-50 employees  (n = 52)  25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile Base pay $378,000 $427,500 $529,900 Total compensation $449,000 $504,900 $649,600  And here is the aggregate information about total compensation for CEOs among foundations with more than $1.5 billion in assets.        CEO Compensation at Foundations with more than $1.5 billion in assets (n = 36, overlaps with above) \n\n 25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile Base pay $561,000 $671,500 $763,100 Total compensation $675,600 $781,100 $981,500  Notes:   ● These data are not adjusted for cost--of--living, although most of the foundations are based in large American cities. ● The 36 foundations surveyed with $1.5 billion in assets or more had a median grants payout of $124 million. We chose this tier because its median payout was the closest to GiveWell's money moved. GiveWell's estimate of total money directed to charities in 2016 is $118,594,102.1 The next tier down in the compensation survey we relied on had a median annual grants payout of $32 million. ● Details of this data and definitions are available in Exhibit A.  Research not-for-profits  We pulled the available staff compensation information from nine research or charity-review-oriented not-for-profits: Innovations for Poverty Action, IDinsight, Evidence Action, Center for Global Development, Center for Effective Philanthropy, Urban Institute, Guidestar, Charity Navigator, and Results for Development.   Here are the summary statistics for the salaries of the president, CEO, or Executive Director at those organizations in their 2015 990s:  Compensation for Presidents and/or CEOs at 9 orgs from 2016 990s  25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile Base pay $201,647 $235,459 $337,149 Total compensation $213,223 $265,402 $383,544  Notes: ● We have not adjusted for cost--of--living. ● Evidence Action’s CEO served until November 2016. We extrapolated his published salary to cover all twelve months of 2016. ● Details of this data are available in Exhibit B.  Academics                                                   1 Source: GiveWell Metrics Report – 2016 Annual Review \n\nWe think that professors at UC Berkeley make for good comparisons because Berkeley is a well-regarded school (and therefore ought to give some indication of what sort of pay attracts top tier intellectuals in a not-for-profit environment), is public (so salary information is publicly available), and is located in the Bay Area.  We believe that economics professors make the most appropriate comparison for Elie within this data set.  Below are summary statistics for the compensation of Berkeley economics professors in 2016.   Compensation for UC Berkeley economics professors in 2016  (n = 44)  25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile Base pay $165,725 $250,648 $287,940 Total compensation $206,405 $308,025 $347,620    There were nine professors who received their BAs in 2004 or later (the year Elie graduated from college):  BA year Gross Pay 2010 $192,310 2010 $204,869 2009 $206,917 2008 $204,721 2006 $191,475 2005 $195,633 2004 $195,800 2004 $227,380 2004 $219,448  Note that professors typically have ~3 months per year, and ~1 day per week during the remaining months, for pursuing side engagements, including paid ones. Elie works full--time at GiveWell.  Details of this data are available in Exhibit B. \n\nOpen Philanthropy compensation [Redacted]  Compensation proposal  We propose a compensation raise for Elie from $200,000 to $250,000. Elie currently receives no non-salary compensation from GiveWell.  "

All expenses \nexceeding such amounts shall be approved by the audit committee of the board.  \n \nThe Ex ecutive Director may delegate authority to sign checks and notes to any employee of GiveWell. The \nExecutive Director remains responsible for ensuring that all such checks and notes follow the applicable \nrequirements laid out elsewhere in these By -Laws.  \n \n4. Compensation Approval Policies  \n \nSection 1. Compensation Approval Policies   \n \nA voting member of the governing board who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the \ncorporation for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member's compensation.  \n \nA voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives \ncompensation, directly or indirectly, from the corporation for services is precluded from voting on matters \npertaining to that member's compensation.  \n \nNo voting member of the governing board or any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation \nmatters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the corporation, either individually or \ncollectively, is prohibited from providing information to any committee regarding compensation.  \n \nWhen appr oving compensation for directors, officers and employees, contractors, and any other \ncompensation contract or arrangement, in addition to complying with the corporation’s conflict of interest \nrequirements and policies, the board or a duly constituted compe nsation committee of the board shall also \ncomply with the following additional requirements and procedures:  \n \na. The terms of compensation shall be approved by the board or compensation committee prior to the first \npayment of compensation,  \n \nb. All members  of the board or compensation committee who approve compensation arrangements must \nnot have a conflict of interest with respect to the compensation arrangement as specified in IRS \nRegulation Section 53.4958 -6(c)(iii), which generally requires that each boa rd member or committee \nmember approving a compensation arrangement between this organization and a \"disqualified person\" \n(as defined in Section 4958(f)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code and as amplified by Section 53.4958 -3 \nof the IRS Regulations):  \n\n \n1. is n ot the person who is the subject of the compensation arrangement, or a family member of such \nperson;  \n \n2. is not in an employment relationship subject to the direction or control of the person who is the subject \nof the compensation arrangement;  \n \n3. does not receive compensation or other payments subject to approval by the person who is the subject of \nthe compensation arrangement;  \n \n4. has no material financial interest affected by the compensation arrangement; and  \n \n5. does not approve a transaction pr oviding economic benefits to the person who is the subject of the \ncompensation arrangement, who in turn has approved or will approve a transaction providing benefits to \nthe board or committee member.  \n \nc. The board or compensation committee shall obtain an d rely upon appropriate data as to comparability \nprior to approving the terms of compensation. Appropriate data may include the following:  \n \n1. Compensation levels paid by similarly situated organizations, both taxable and tax -exempt, for \nfunctionally comp arable positions. \"Similarly situated\" organizations are those of a similar size, purpose, \nand with similar resources.  \n \n2. The availability of similar services in the geographic area of this organization.  \n \n3. Current compensation surveys compiled by indepe ndent firms.  \n \n4. Actual written offers from similar institutions competing for the services of the person who is the \nsubject of the compensation arrangement.  \n \nAs allowed by IRS Regulation 4958 -6, if this organization has average annual gross receipts (inc luding \ncontributions) for its three prior tax years of less than $1 million, the board or compensation committee \nwill have obtained and relied upon appropriate data as to comparability if it obtains and relies upon data \non compensation paid by three compar able organizations in the same or similar communities for similar \nservices.  \n \nd. The terms of compensation and the basis for approving them shall be recorded in written minutes of the \nmeeting of the board or compensation committee that approved the compens ation. Such documentation \nshall include:  \n \n1. The terms of the compensation arrangement and the date it was approved.  \n \n2. The members of the board or compensation committee who were present during debate on the \ntransaction, those who voted on it, and the v otes cast by each board or committee member.  \n \n3. The comparability data obtained and relied upon and how the data was obtained.  \n \n\n4. If the board or compensation committee determines that reasonable compensation for a specific position \nin this organization or for providing services under any other compensation arrangement with this \norganization is higher or lower than the range of comparability data obtained, the board or committee \nshall record in the minutes of the meeting the basis for its determination.  \n \n5. If the board or committee makes adjustments to  comparability data due to geographic area or other \nspecific conditions, these adjustments and the reasons for them shall be recorded in the minutes of the \nboard or committee meeting.  \n \n6. Any actions taken with respect to determining if a board or committ ee member had a conflict of \ninterest with respect to the compensation arrangement, and if so, actions taken to make sure the member \nwith the conflict of interest did not affect or participate in the approval of the transaction (for example, a \nnotation in t he records that after a finding of conflict of interest by a member, the member with the conflict \nof interest was asked to, and did, leave the meeting prior to a discussion of the compensation arrangement \nand a taking of the votes to approve the arrangemen t).  \n \n7. The minutes of board or committee meetings at which compensation arrangements are approved must \nbe prepared before the later of the date of the next board or committee meeting or 60 days after the final \nactions of the board or committee are taken with respect to the approval of the compensation \narrangements. The minutes must be reviewed and approved by the board and committee as reasonable, \naccurate, and complete within a reasonable period thereafter, normally prior to or at the next board or \ncommi ttee meeting following final action on the arrangement by the board or committee.  \n \nSection 2. Annual Statements   \n \nEach director, principal officer, and member of a committee with governing board delegated powers shall \nannually sign a statement which affir ms such person:  \na. has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,  \nb. has read and understands the policy,  \nc. has agreed to comply with the policy, and  \nd. understands the corporation is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax exemp tion it must \nengage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax -exempt purposes.  \n \nSection 3. Periodic Reviews   \n \nTo ensure the corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage \nin activities that c ould jeopardize its tax -exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic \nreviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:  \na. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey \ninformation, and the result of arm's -length bargaining.  \nb. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to \nthe corporation's written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for \ngoods an d services, further charitable purposes, and do not result in inurement, impermissible private \nbenefit, or in an excess benefit transaction.  \n \nSection 4. Use of Outside Experts   \n \n\nWhen conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Section 3, the corporation may, but need not, use \noutside advisors. If outside experts are used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its \nresponsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are  conducted.  \n \nFURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board hereby authorizes the officers of GiveWell to do and \nperform all such further acts and to execute such documents as shall be necessary or advisable in \norder to carry out the foregoing resolutions.  \n \n \nThese actions collectively taken by the board of directors on April 30, 2019.

Whitney’s team, for example, is responsible for\nprocessing donations to our recommended charities, and for\npreparing GiveWell to increase the size of its staﬀ. Ben is\nleading experiments to evaluate diﬀerent ways we might\nincrease the amount of funding we direct to our top charities\nvia marketing and outreach.\nFull details of our performance against our 2018 outreach and\noperations goals are here.\nResearch\nWe completed several projects that improved the quality of our\ncost-eﬀectiveness estimates and how we write about them, andHow GiveWell’s\nresearch is\nevolving\nSchedule a quick\ncall to make\ngiving easier\nDecember 2018\nopen thread\nStaff members’\npersonal\ndonations for\ngiving season\n2018\nWe’ve added\nmore options for\ncryptocurrency\ndonors\nResponse to\nconcerns about\nGiveWell’s\nspillovers\nanalysis\nFOLLOW US:\nRecent CommentsAdded senior hires in operations and outreach: a\nDirector of Operations (Whitney Shinkle) and Head of\nGrowth (Ben Bateman)..\nContinued to improve and expand our core research\nproduct, completing new intervention reports,\ndeepening our analysis for several key inputs into our\ncost-eﬀectiveness model, and providing more\ntransparent explanations for how we decided to allocate\nfunds between top charities..\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Review of GiveW ell's work in 2018 - The GiveW ell Blog\nhttps://blog.givewell.or g/?p=1 1977&preview=true 3/5that we believe led to be\u0000er decisions about where to allocate\nfunds. For example, we made a major change to how we\ncalculate worm intensity in the areas where our top charities\nwork.\nWe also improved our transparency about these decisions,\nbreaking our blog posts announcing our top charities into\ncomponent parts to make them easier to follow (see 1, 2, and 3)\nand delving into more detail on our principles and funding gap\nanalyses.\nWe published ﬁve new intervention reports, two of which were\non the evidence for community-based management of acute\nmalnutrition and syphilis screening and treatment during\npregnancy, and recommended ﬁve new GiveWell Incubation\nGrants and two grant renewals. Two of our new grants\nsupported Evidence Action Beta’s incubator and J-PAL’s\nInnovation in Government Initiative, respectively.\nFull details of our performance on our 2018 research goals are\nhere.\nKey failures\nOutreach and operations\nWe took a number of steps to improve our outreach to\nGiveWell’s existing donors. We had hoped this would lead to\nmaterial improvements in retention of our donors as well as the\namount of funding we were able to direct to our top charities\nfrom our donors. We haven’t completed a careful assessment of\nthis work, but our belief at this point is that the steps we took\nlast year are unlikely to have had a signiﬁcant impact on donor\nretention.\nResearchJAMES (GIVEWELL)\nCOMMENTED ON\nWhat is it like to\nwork at\nGiveWell?\nJOHN COMMENTED ON\nWhat is it like to\nwork at\nGiveWell?\nSAM COMMENTED ON\nAllocation of\ndiscretionary\nfunds from Q4\n2018\nWAYNE CHANG\nCOMMENTED ON\nAllocation of\ndiscretionary\nfunds from Q4\n2018\nISABEL ARJMAND\nCOMMENTED ON\nAllocation of\ndiscretionary\nfunds from Q4\n2018\nMILAN GRIFFES\nCOMMENTED ON\nMarch 2019 open\nthread\nJOSH (GIVEWELL)\nCOMMENTED ON\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Review of GiveW ell's work in 2018 - The GiveW ell Blog\nhttps://blog.givewell.or g/?p=1 1977&preview=true 4/5New Comme nt\nLogged in as Catherine Hollander.

Explore areas that may be more cost-effective than our current\nrecommendations but don’t ﬁt neatly into our current criteria\n2018 post: goal 2018 post: What does success look like?Did we\nachieve\nthis\ngoal?\nExplore areas that may be more cost-\neffective than our current\nrecommendations but don’t ﬁt neatly\ninto our current criteriainvestigating (i) interventions aimed at\ninﬂuencing policy in low- and middle-income\ncountries and (ii) opportunities to inﬂuence\nmajor aid agencies.(i) No\n(ii) Yes\n(in spirit)\nOn goal (i), we spent some time investigating causes within policy-oriented philanthropy in the ﬁrst\npart of 2018, and made progress in our understanding of tobacco taxation and lead paint regulation.\nWe also completed an investigation of J-P AL's Innovation in Government Initiative  and\nrecommended a grant in support of its work.\nBy June 2018, however , we decided to reallocate how the researcher leading our policy work,\nJames Snowden, spent his time, and he shifted his focus to our current top charities. W e did not\nmeet our goal for progress in this area in 2018.\nOn goal (ii), we made progress toward better understanding how governments allocate aid and had\nseveral preliminary conversations to explore ways in which GiveW ell could be helpful.\n2. Find new top charities that meet our current criteria\n2018 2018 post: What does success look like? Did we\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Progress in 2018\nhttps://www .givewell.or g/print/node/3088 2/8post:\ngoalachieve\nthis\ngoal?\nFind\nnew top\ncharities\nthat\nmeet\nour\ncurrent\ncriteria(i) completing intervention reports for at least two interventions we think are\nlikely to result in GiveW ell top charities by the end of 2019, (ii) considering\nrenewal of GiveW ell Incubation Grants to current grantee organizations that\nmay become top charities in the future and making new Incubation Grants,\nand (iii) developing and maintaining high-quality relationships with charities,\nfunders, and inﬂuencers in the global health and development community; on\n(iii), we set speciﬁc goals of:\nhaving at least one call or meeting with at least 60 dif ferent charities that\nwe have not recommended or made an Incubation Grant to and at least\n100 such calls or meetings in total.\nhaving at least ﬁve multi-program organizations with budgets of more\nthan $50 million annually express interest in being considered for our\ntop charity recommendation for a speciﬁc, promising program, if we\ninvite them to apply\nprioritizing research work beyond an initial, brief evidence assessment\non at least ﬁve interventions that we became aware of through\nprofessional networks.(i) Yes\n(in spirit)\n(ii) Yes\n(iii) No\nIn the case of (i), we evaluated and published reports on ﬁve new programs: community-based\nmanagement of acute malnutrition , syphilis screening and treatment during pregnancy ,\nbreastfeeding promotion , Alive & Thrive , and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during\npregnancy . We also named Georgetown University Initiative on Innovation, Development, and\nEvaluation's Zusha! Road Safety Campaign  as a standout charity .\nIn the case of (ii), we made ﬁve new Incubation Grants: Evidence Action Beta’ s work on iron and\nfolic acid supplementation , Nick Otis’ s forecasting research , Fortify Health , Evidence Action Beta’ s\nincubator , and J-PAL’s Innovation in Government Initiative . We also completed renewals for two\nIncubation Grants: IDinsight’ s embedded team  and phase 2 of Evidence Action Beta’ s work on iron\nand folic acid supplementation .\nIn the case of (iii), we decided to deprioritize this goal. W e are no longer pursuing this as an\nindependent goal, and plan to develop relationships in service of other major goals.\n3. Improve our internal processes to support the above goals\n2018 post: goal 2018 post: What does success look like?Did we\nachieve\nthis\ngoal?\nImprove our internal\nprocesses to\nsupport the above\ngoalsWe plan to continue to [(i)] delegate signiﬁcant parts of our top\ncharity update process to non-management staf f and [(ii)] to\nimprove our year-end process for making recommendations.(i)\nPartially\n(ii) Yes\n(in spirit)\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Progress in 2018\nhttps://www .givewell.or g/print/node/3088 3/8Related to goal (i), we signiﬁcantly reduced the amount of senior staf f time spent on work related to\ntop charity updates. Newer and more junior staf f took on a large amount of work related to top\ncharity updates , cost-ef fectiveness analyses , tracking new academic evidence, updating our\nintervention reports , and managing conversation notes .\nRelated to goal (ii), we made signiﬁcant improvements to our year-end process for making charity\nrecommendations. W e failed to meet two internal deadlines we set for completing intervention-\nrelated work and top charity work, though we did publish many of our top charity reviews well in\nadvance of our external deadline, which left more time for staf f engagement with our\nrecommendations this year . This enabled us to better vet and communicate about our conclusions.\n4. Continue following our top charities and address priority questions\n2018 post:\ngoal2018 post: What does success look like?Did we\nachieve\nthis\ngoal?\nContinue\nfollowing our top\ncharities and\naddress priority\nquestionsWe are devoting fewer resources than we have in the past to top\ncharity updates. W e plan to continue gathering up-to-date information\nto allow us to make high-quality allocation decisions for giving\nseason, and to answer a small number of high-priority questions.Yes\nWe made important updates to our understanding of our top charities and the interventions they\nimplement. These included:\nMaking a major change to how we calculate worm intensity  in the areas where our top\ncharities that implement deworming programs work.\nBeginning to account for the potential long-term development beneﬁts  of vitamin A\nsupplementation in our cost-ef fectiveness model, in order to be more consistent with the\napproach we take for our other priority programs.\nAssessing new research on the potential spillover ef fects of cash transfers .\nUpdating our views on how successful several top charities have been in collecting information\nabout the reach and ef fectiveness of their programs (their monitoring data). For Helen Keller\nInternational's vitamin A supplementation program, Malaria Consortium's seasonal malaria\nchemoprevention program, and Sightsavers' deworming program, our conﬁdence in their\nmonitoring data increased. For the Against Malaria Foundation and Evidence Action's Deworm\nthe W orld Initiative, our conﬁdence in the consistency with which they collect and share\nmonitoring data decreased somewhat.\nIncorporating new information from our top charities on their past spending, results achieved,\nand future plans to model how best to allocate additional funding among our top charities to\nmaximize cost-ef fectiveness.\n5. Secondary: Improve the quality of our decisions and transparency about our\ndecision-making process\n2018 post: goal2018 post: What does\nsuccess look like?Did we\nachieve this\ngoal?\nSecondary: Improve the quality of our decisions and\ntransparency about our decision-making process.Not speciﬁed. Yes\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Progress in 2018\nhttps://www .givewell.or g/print/node/3088 4/8We made progress on this goal (potentially at the expense of our primary goals) by:\nCreating a more detailed explanation of our funding recommendations to Good V entures  and\nother donors.\nAdding additional clarity about our decision-making process by attempting to quantify  potential\nbeneﬁts and downside not included in our cost-ef fectiveness analysis.\nAdding a country selection tab  to our cost-ef fectiveness analysis so that users can toggle\nbetween overall and country-speciﬁc cost-ef fectiveness estimates.\n6. Secondary: Hire more ﬂexible research capacity to increase our output\n2018 post: goal2018 post: What does\nsuccess look like?Did we achieve\nthis goal?\nSecondary: Hire more ﬂexible research\ncapacity to increase our output.Not speciﬁed. Yes\nWe hired a Senior Research Analyst, a Senior Fellow , and three Content Editors. In addition, two\nResearch Analysts accepted of fers to work at GiveW ell. However , three research staf f left GiveW ell\nin 2018.\n7. Secondary: Complete reviews of two new potential top charities\n2018 post: goal2018 post: What does\nsuccess look like?Did we achieve\nthis goal?\nSecondary: Complete reviews of two new\npotential top charities.Not speciﬁed. No\nWe did not publish reviews of any new potential top charities in 2018, outside of GiveW ell Incubation\nGrant recipients, which may be potential future top charities, but are outside of the scope of what\nthis goal was intended to capture.\nOutreach\nWe wrote about our 2018 outreach goals here.\n1. Hire a Head of Growth\n2018 post: goal2018 post: What does success look\nlike?Did we achieve this\ngoal?\nHire a Head of\nGrowth.Hire a Head of Growth Yes\nWe hired Ben Bateman as GiveW ell's Head of Growth. He joined GiveW ell in June 2018.\n2. Improve the post-donation experience\n2018\npost:\ngoal2018 post: What does success look like?Did we\nachieve\nthis\ngoal?\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Progress in 2018\nhttps://www .givewell.or g/print/node/3088 5/8Improve\nthe post-\ndonation\nexperience.Signiﬁcantly improve our process for post-donation follow-up before giving\nseason 2018.\nAt this point, we’re still in the earliest stages of ﬁguring out how we’ll do\nthis, so we don’t have concrete goals for the year beyond ﬁnalizing our\nplan in the next few months. Our stretch goal for the year is to succeed in\nachieving measured improvement in our dollar retention rate/lifetime value\nof each donor .No\nWe made signiﬁcant progress on developing our framework for donor retention, including by\ncleaning up the data we have so we can more reliably send mass emails and considering our\noutreach strategies. W e also completed an email ﬂow to encourage donors to give by year-end.\nHowever , we have yet to ﬁgure out how to best serve most of our donors, and we don't believe the\nwork we did in 2018 will signiﬁcantly change our donor retention.\n3. Secondary: Continue advertising on podcasts\n2018 post: goal 2018 post: What does success look like?Did we\nachieve this\ngoal?\nSecondary goal: Continue\nadvertising on podcasts.Advertise on new podcasts and measure results\nto decide how much to spend in 2019.Yes\nIn 2018, we spent ~$245,000 on podcast advertising, up from ~$90,000 in 2017 , on podcast ads.\nWe spent more in part due to higher prices to advertise on the same podcasts as last year , and also\nbecause we were experimenting with new podcasts that targeted wider audiences. W e advertised\non The Ezra Klein Show , The W eeds, FiveThirtyEight Politics, V ery Bad Wizards, Science Vs.,\nRadiolab, and Rationally Speaking.\nThe ads we ran in 2018 had signiﬁcantly lower directly-measured returns than the ads in 2017\n(~45% vs. ~100% in 2017). Some loss of ROI may be due to large donors migrating to our check\nand wire transfer forms (which is how we recommend larger donors give ), which don't include the\nquestion \"where did you hear about GiveW ell?\" (and so thus would not be credited to podcast\nadvertising); we would guess this doesn't account for the full picture. Podcast ad prices were also\nhigher this year overall and podcasts may have been running more ads in general, which may have\ncontributed to worse ROI overall if each individual ad was less ef fective.\n4. Secondary: Receive coverage in major news outlets\n2018 post: goal 2018 post: What does success look like?Did we\nachieve this\ngoal?\nSecondary goal: Receive\ncoverage in major news\noutlets.Pitch major news outlets on at least ﬁve stories\nin total and get at least one story covered.No\nWe did not prioritize pitching major media on coverage of GiveW ell, although we did receive\ncoverage in major news outlets, including The New Y ork T imes , Vox, and The Economist .\n5. Secondary: Deepen relationships with the effective altruism community\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Progress in 2018\nhttps://www .givewell.or g/print/node/3088 6/82018 post: goal 2018 post: What does\nsuccess look like?Did we achieve\nthis goal?\nSecondary goal: Deepen relationships with the\neffective altruism community .Not speciﬁed. Yes\nCatherine Hollander , a research analyst focused on outreach at GiveW ell, spoke at three effective\naltruism (EA)  conferences in 2018: in San Francisco , Melbourne, and London . She also attended\ntwo EA retreats, and deepened her relationships with her counterparts at EA organizations.\nAdditional GiveW ell staf f attended the EA conferences in San Francisco and London, and had\ncontact with EA organizations at various points in the year .\nOperations\nWe wrote about our 2018 operations goals here.\n1. Appoint a new Director of Operations (complete)\n2018 post: goal2018 post:\nWhat does\nsuccess\nlook like?Did we\nachieve\nthis\ngoal?\nAppoint a new Director of Operations (complete). In April 2018, we hired\nWhitney Shinkle as our new Director of Operations. Between January\nand April 2018, Natalie Crispin served as our interim Director of\nOperations.Appoint a\nnew Director\nof Operations.Yes\nWhitney Shinkle joined GiveW ell as Director of Operations in April 2018.\n2. Prepare our systems for major growth in outreach\n2018 post: goal2018 post: What\ndoes success look\nlike?Did we\nachieve\nthis goal?\nPrepare our systems for major growth in outreach, which we\nexpect to lead to increases in spending, staf f, and\ndonations.Not speciﬁed. Partially\nSpending (ﬁnance) . We made several major improvements to our ﬁnance work in 2018, including\nconsolidating our schedule and accounting processes with our bookkeeping ﬁrm and setting a more\naggressive timeline for major annual ﬁnancial milestones with our tax and audit partners; initiating\nproduction of new metrics to track our accounting processes and organizational ﬁnancial health; and\nexecuting the ﬁrst draft of a ﬁnancial policy and procedures guide to codify and record our ﬁnance\npractices (this provides clarity , protection, and consistency across vendors, personnel, and\nregulatory changes).\nDonations . We continue to explore options to increase donations-processing efﬁciency , but we didn't\nidentify a comprehensive approach that we're conﬁdent would support 4-10x growth in volume of\ndonations. W e made or are testing individual improvements to our data entry and donations-\nprocessing systems, which have anecdotally had positive results.\n3. Maintain critical operations across domains\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Progress in 2018\nhttps://www .givewell.or g/print/node/3088 7/82018 post: goal2018 post: What\ndoes success look\nlike?Did we\nachieve this\ngoal?\nMaintain critical operations across domains: donations,\nﬁnance, HR, ofﬁce, website, recruiting, and staf f cohesion.Not speciﬁed. Yes\nWe maintained our critical operations in 2018. These include, but aren't limited to:\nProcessing donations we receive from donors and responding to questions related to\ndonations in a timely manner .\nAddressing legal and governance issues to stay in compliance with nonproﬁt laws and satisfy\ninternal due diligence questions.\nMaintaining a clean, efﬁcient professional workspace.\nHiring and onboarding new staf f to serve key roles at GiveW ell.\nHosting events to encourage staf f cohesion.\n4. Major operations projects we aim to complete in the ﬁrst half of 2018:\nSigniﬁcant improvement in our approach to budgeting\n2018 post: goal2018 post: What\ndoes success\nlook like?Did we\nachieve\nthis goal?\nA signiﬁcant improvement in our approach to budgeting making\nit signiﬁcantly easier for us to share updated actual spending\nversus budget.Not speciﬁed. Partially\nWe completed programming of our ﬁnancial management software to enable us to track revenue\nand expenses in close to real time and run multiple levels of reports on up-to-a-daily basis.\n5. Major operations projects we aim to complete in the ﬁrst half of 2018:\nCompensation consultant\n2018 post: goal2018 post: What\ndoes success look\nlike?Did we\nachieve\nthis goal?\nWe retained a compensation consultant to help us\nbenchmark GiveW ell staf f compensation to comparable\norganizations.Not speciﬁed. Yes\nWe retained this consultant and adjusted staf f compensation based on this project.\n6. Major operations projects we aim to complete in the ﬁrst half of 2018: 2017\nmoney moved report\n2018 post: goal2018 post: What\ndoes success look\nlike?Did we\nachieve\nthis goal?\nSecondary: W e published our 2016 metrics report  and plan\nto publish our 2017 money moved report by the end of\nJune.Publish our 2017\nmetrics report by end\nof June.Yes\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] Progress in 2018\nhttps://www .givewell.or g/print/node/3088 8/8We published our 2017 metrics report on June 29, 2018.

Our goal is to have 3-5 signed oﬀer le\u0000ers in hand from\nnew research staﬀ by the end of 2019.\nWe’re hoping to that additional research capacity will enable us\nto expand the scope of GiveWell’s research, with the aim of\nﬁnding opportunities that are more cost-eﬀective than our\ncurrent top charities. We’re planning to roughly double the size\nof the research team over the next few years.\nOutreach experimentation\nWe plan to expand our outreach to current and potential\ndonors going forward, with the aim of increasing the amount of\nmoney we direct to our recommended charities. As part of this\nwork, we recently hired Stephanie Stojanovic as our ﬁrst Major\nGi\u0000s Oﬃcer. Our goal is to decide by the end of the 1st quarter\nof 2020 whether to scale our staﬀ capacity further in the area of\nmajor gi\u0000s, based on Stephanie’s initial work.[1]\nWe’re also planning to conduct experiments in 2019 related to\nhow we message about our work to reach more people. These\nexperiments could include work on search engine optimization\nand building landing pages that aim to communicate what\nGiveWell does and why it’s valuable, among other possibilities.\nWe expect to have results by early 2020, as the bulk of donations\nwe receive are made in December.\nFinally, we’re planning to search for a Director of Outreach to\noversee work across outreach domains (including major gi\u0000s,\ndonor retention, advertising, marketing, and wri\u0000en\ncommunications). We guess there is a 50 percent chance we\nmake a hire for this role in 2019.\nExploring new areas of researchHow GiveWell’s\nresearch is\nevolving\nSchedule a quick\ncall to make\ngiving easier\nDecember 2018\nopen thread\nStaff members’\npersonal\ndonations for\ngiving season\n2018\nWe’ve added\nmore options for\ncryptocurrency\ndonors\nResponse to\nconcerns about\nGiveWell’s\nspillovers\nanalysis\nFOLLOW US:\nRecent Comments\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] GiveW ell's plans for 2019 - The GiveW ell Blog\nhttps://blog.givewell.or g/?p=12069&preview=true 3/8As mentioned above, we’re in the early stages of expanding the\nscope of GiveWell’s research. We plan to look into several new\nareas in 2019, including public health regulation and possible\npaths to support government aid agencies.\nThis work is new for GiveWell, and as noted in our 2018 review\npost, we failed to make as much progress as we hoped in 2018 on\nour work on public health regulation. In 2019, we’re aiming to\nget substantially closer to the point where we have the staﬀ\nstructure to support grantmaking in new areas, though given\nhow early we are in this work, we don’t yet have concrete goals\nwe’re conﬁdent that we’ll achieve.\nA stretch goal for 2019 is to se\u0000le on a structure that we believe\nwill support grantmaking in public health regulation and begin\nmaking grants in that area.\nWe also plan to continue our investigation into possible paths to\nsupport government aid agencies; in particular, we plan to\ncomplete an investigation into an opportunity to do so in the\narea of results-based ﬁnancing.\nImproving GiveWell’s organizational\nstrength\nWe expect to need additional operations capacity to maintain\ncritical functions as GiveWell grows and to improve the\norganization going forward. We plan to hire one Operations\nAssociate this year to assist with general operations needs, such\nas improving HR practices and facilitating organizational\nlearning opportunities.\nWe plan to hire many new staﬀ over the coming years. In\npreparation, we plan to improve our procedures and\ninformation for recruiting, ve\u0000ing, and onboarding staﬀ to\nGiveWell this year, such as by improving inclusive recruitment\npractices, tailoring the substantive content of our onboardingJAMES (GIVEWELL)\nCOMMENTED ON\nWhat is it like to\nwork at\nGiveWell?\nJOHN COMMENTED ON\nWhat is it like to\nwork at\nGiveWell?\nSAM COMMENTED ON\nAllocation of\ndiscretionary\nfunds from Q4\n2018\nWAYNE CHANG\nCOMMENTED ON\nAllocation of\ndiscretionary\nfunds from Q4\n2018\nISABEL ARJMAND\nCOMMENTED ON\nAllocation of\ndiscretionary\nfunds from Q4\n2018\nMILAN GRIFFES\nCOMMENTED ON\nMarch 2019 open\nthread\nJOSH (GIVEWELL)\nCOMMENTED ON\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] GiveW ell's plans for 2019 - The GiveW ell Blog\nhttps://blog.givewell.or g/?p=12069&preview=true 4/8activities, and taking a more employee-centric approach to\nonboarding.

In practice,\nthere are costs and beneﬁts that we do not observe and\nare not estimated in our models, and so we allow for\nqualitative adjustments to aﬀect our recommendations.\nWe’re in the process of laying out a framework for\nqualitatively assessing relative organizational strength..\nUpdating key inputs into our cost-eﬀectiveness\nestimates, such as:.\nHow we use vitamin A deﬁciency data. .\nUsing new malaria prevalence and child\nmortality data..\nUsing new data to update the our estimates of\ncosts incurred and target population reached for.2019\nMarch\nFebruary\n2018\n\n4/24/2019 [Draft] GiveW ell's plans for 2019 - The GiveW ell Blog\nhttps://blog.givewell.or g/?p=12069&preview=true 5/8Conclusion\nThe concrete goals we aim to achieve in 2019 follow. We plan to\nrevisit this list in early 2020 to assess our progress relative to\nour expectations, and to publish a blog post accounting for our\nwork:ﬁve of our top charities: Malaria Consortium’s\nseasonal malaria chemoprevention program, the\nAgainst Malaria Foundation, Helen Keller\nInternational’s vitamin A supplementation\nprogram, Sightsavers’ deworming program, and\nEvidence Action’s Deworm the World Initiative.\nBe\u0000er understanding the counterfactual to the\nwork Evidence Action’s Deworm the World\nInitiative has done in India (more information\nbelow).

In late 2018 Garrell created and conducted an anonymous 360° review of Elie that surveyed six of Elie’s direct reports from the senior staff.   Overall, the review of Elie’s management and GiveWell’s status were positive. No major areas of concern were raised. Several consistent areas for improvement were noted.  Elie and Scott have discussed and are working on a plan to address the following identified areas for improvement:  ● Listening  ● Delegation  ● Inspirational Leadership   The detailed responses from staff are available in the following document (anonymous and with staff permission). [REDACTED]  We will be considering this model as part of our exploration of options for instituting feedback on GiveWell’s managers organization-wide later in 2019.  "

Periodic Review To ensure the corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:  a. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's-length bargaining.  b. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to the corporation's written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes, and do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit, or in an excess benefit transaction.

Record retention  Clear Fund’s records are retained, in either electronic or paper format,  according to the schedule below, in compliance with government, legal, and funders’ requirements. When there is a conflict between federal, state and local record retention requirements, the longer retention period prevails. Certain important records, as determined by the Board, will be retained permanently, even if their retention is not required by law.  Record destruction  Once the retention period has expired, The Clear Fund may destroy the records in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of its contents. The Board of Directors approves all destruction of records prior to commencement.  Record destruction is performed under the direction of the Executive Director, who is responsible for maintaining all Certificates of Destruction.  Upon receipt of any legal notice, all record destruction will cease until the end of the investigation, if any.  Review of policy  Record retention requirements are reviewed annually with the Board and independent auditors to determine any necessary changes.

          "text": "GiveWell's recent progress and future plans  \n \n \nWhat is GiveWell's mission?  \nWhat are our major areas of growth?  \nHow are we moving towards these in 2019?  \nWhat did we do in 2018?  \n2018 money moved  \n2018 staff departures  \nResearch was especially capacity constrained in 2018.  \nWhat did not go well in 2018?  \n \nWhat is GiveWell's mission?  \n \nGiveWell's mission is to find outstanding giving opportunities and publish the full details of our \nanalysis to help donors decide where to give.  \n \nWe accomplish our mission by finding the most cost -effective giving opportunities we can and \ndirecting as much money as possible to those recommendations (our money moved).  \n \nWhat are ou r major areas of growth?  \n  \nThey are:  \n  \n● Increasing money moved.  We're working to significantly increase the amount of money \nmoved.  \n○ By metrics year 2022 (i.e., February 2022 -January 2023), annually move $100 \nmillion ex -Good Ventures to our recommendations. This will mean nearly $200 \nmillion in total money moved and that we're the 2nd (or nearly the 2nd) largest \nprivate funder of global health and development.  \n● Building research capacity. We're working to build up the capacity and capabilities  of \nour research team.  \n○ In the next few years, we're planning to have a research team of at least 30 \npeople; we are currently 16. We plan to add 3 additional research managers (for \na total of 5) and a Research Director to lead the team. This capacity will e nable \nus to achieve the goals below.  \n● Researching new areas. We're expanding the scope of our research to consider \nopportunities that we believe are higher impact -per-dollar but rely on less robust \nevidence.  \n○ We aim to direct a significant amount of funding (~$25 million+ / year) to giving \nopportunities that we believe are significantly more cost -effective (~3x) than \n\nwhere we would otherwise direct our marginal dollar. We expect these \nopportunities to be in policy.  \n● Improving research transparency. We intend t o significantly improve the legibility of \nour process and conclusions to the outside world.  \n○ We plan to publish our conclusions about charities and programs that we've \nresearched. We plan to have and share conclusions about programs (e.g., \neducation) and an swer questions (e.g., how should we value health systems \nstrengthening) that donors care about.  \n● Influencing aid agencies. We are working to expand the scope of our work to influence \nand improve the spending of government donors who collectively move tens o f billions of \ndollars annually to global health and development.  \n○ This area is very new so we're not sure what represents a reasonable target. The \ntype of goal we will have is to either move a significant amount of funding \n(~$100m in annual funding) from g overnment aid agencies to our priority \nprograms or significantly improve the cost -effectiveness of a larger pool of \nfunding (~$500m by a factor of 2).  \n● Building a strong organization. We're expanding our operations team to support the \nactivities of a signif icantly larger organization.  \n○ We see emerging needs in HR and finance due to our larger size. We retained \nDavid Mozaffarian as a consulting CFO to advise us on ongoing priorities in \nfinance  \n○ We intend to hire two new full -time staff members on the Operations  team.  \n○ We're putting time into improving our onboarding, formalizing a regular cycle for \nstaff feedback and defining our core values.  \n \nThe spreadsheet in this footnote shows the progress we hope to make each year towards these \nhigh-level goals.1 \n \nHow are w e moving towards these in 2019?  \n \nIn 2019, we are working towards these goals by:  \n \n● Increasing money moved.  \n○ Hiring a VP Marketing to lead the outreach team. In 2019, we believe there's a \n50% chance we make this hire.  \n○ We hired Steph Stojanovic, who started Ju ne 1st as a Major GIfts Officer. She's \nfocused on increasing donations from existing large donors. In 2019, Steph's \ngoal is to move an additional $1 -2 million.  \n○ Ben Bateman, our Head of Growth, is focused on finding and converting new \ndonors. In 2019, Ben's  goal is to move an additional $1 -2 million.  \n                                                 \n1 This spreadsheet is still a work in progress. The current version is our first draft. It doesn't contain \neverything we want it to: for example, we have to flesh out the details and progress of our operations \nplan, and we haven't prioritized pres enting it in an easy -to-consume way. There is no need to review it, \nbut if you'd like to you can see it here. \n\n● Building research capacity.  We plan to add a total of 5 additional people to the team in \n2019:  \n○ Two additional team members are starting in September: Alex Cohen as a Senior \nFellow and Alicia Weng as a Research Analyst. (Michael Eddy started in June.)  \n○ We're also aiming to add another Senior RA and two Content Editors.  \n○ In addition, we're aiming to add one more personnel manager; currently, Josh \nand Natalie are the only two personnel managers on the research team.  \n● Researching new areas.  \n○ Exploring public health regulation (e.g., lead regulation, tobacco taxation) to \nidentify important, neglected areas that might be susceptible to philanthropic \ninvestment.  \n○ In 2019, we aim to complete our high -level expl oration of policy areas and to \ndecide whether to prioritize alcohol as a cause area, which would lead us to \nbegin a search for a program officer, focused on alcohol policy.  \n● Improving research transparency.  We don't plan to make significant progress against  \nthis goal in 2019. We expect to make more progress in 2020, when we have more \ncapacity.  \n● Influencing aid agencies.  We hired Michael Eddy on a 6 -month contract to explore \nopportunities with aid agencies.  \n● Building a strong organization. We're expanding our o perations team to support the \nactivities of a significantly larger organization.  \n○ We see emerging needs in HR and finance due to our larger size.  \n \nWhat did we do in 2018?  \n \nIn 2018, we made progress towards these priorities by:  \n \n● Hiring Dan Brown, Tom Sittler, Marinella Capriati, and Amar Radia on the research team  \n● Hiring Ben Bateman as Head of Growth  \n● Hiring Whitney Shinkle as Director of Operations  \n \n2018 money moved  \n \nIn 2018, we moved significantly more money (ex -Good Ventures) than we had in 2017. We \nmoved approximately $65 million in 2018, relative to approximately $45 million in 2017.  \n \nThis increase was mostly driven by two donors giving $15 million more than they had in \nprevious years. We worked hard to maintain and build these donors relationships in 2017 and \n2018 but we would guess that this increase is mostly not attributable to our actions.  \n \nResearch was especially capacity constrained in 2018.  \n \nNatalie was interim Director of Operations during the first half of the year (from the time Sarah \nWard left until Whitney was onboarded), and she was out of parental leave during the 4th \n\nquarter, one of the busiest for the team. Her absence on the research team led to additional \nburden on Josh and James which slowed us down on other priorities.  \n \n "

          "text": "DRAFT Proposal:  \nGiveWell LifeCycle Feedback Program  \nProgram Background  \nOperations Goals  \nGiveWell Operations has the following overarching goals and purpose.  \nTo make Givewell:  \n● A place where top talent wants to work  \n● A place where top talent can work effectively, and  \n● A sector -leading organization that can continue to exist sustainably.  \nFeedback purpose  \nGiveWell considers staff feedback a key (though incomplete) indicator of our success in \nachieving the top two above g oals. GiveWell will solicit staff feedback on an ongoing basis in \norder to assess staff satisfaction and identify potential problems impacting effectiveness that \nrequire attention. We will use this information to identify trends over time and within variou s \nsub-groups of the organization (e.g. individual departments or managed teams)  \nFeedback Priorities  \nOur priorities in soliciting this information are to:  \n● Ensure staff have an opportunity to be heard throughout their entire tenure at GiveWell \nfrom onboardi ng through separation  \n● Provide a mixture of solicitation vehicles to suit various communication styles, comfort \nlevels, and subject matter  \n● Capture both high level trends and actionable/specific  feedback on specific issues  \n● Balance the need for actionable inf ormation with administrative burden on staff to \nadminister or respond to solicitations  \n● Avoid “feedback fatigue” and/or data overload (resulting in non -implementation)  \nFeedback Structure  \nTo meet these competing priorities, GiveWell intends to design a progr am that includes:  \n● Annual and more frequent components  \n● Routine and opportunistic components  \n● Confidential and attributed formats  \n● Comprehensive surveying and nuanced interviewing formats  \n \n\nWe further expect that some of these components will evolve over time as we become more \nproficient in soliciting key information and in tracking this data to discover which methods and \nquestions elicit the most useful information and are most appreciated by staff.  \nProgram Design  \nAll Staff  \nThe following are components of  the program that will be offered in an All -Staff setting or with \nthe expectation that all staff are invited to participate in a joint event.  \nAnnual Components  \n● Annual Flex Survey  \nWhat is it: Once -yearly, confidential survey inquiring into the full range o f employee \nexperiences, including satisfaction with various factors like role, compensation, work -life \nbalance, work environment, manager, project opportunities, etc. This will be \nadministered and analyzed by a professional survey company that provides man y options \nfor customization, multiple levels and forms of data analysis, including data coding, \ncompartmentalization, and personalized debriefing for staff and management. Having a \nrelatively consistent feedback form will also enable us  to easily track tre nds over time.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Management can access data responses and analysis  at all staff, \ndepartment, managed team, and other customized levels of compartmentalization. Senior \nmanagers will review the feedback as a group and managers may review d epartment data \nas a team. A report -out will be presented to All Staff every year. Specific actions will be \ndetermined by management in response to the data.  \n \n● Executive Director Office Hours  \nWhat is it: The E.D. will host a series of open visitation periods  for all staff. Staff may \nsign-up for a 1:1 or small group session. At present, these will likely be offered more than \nonce a year given our small size but the E.D. will formally commit to an annual event.  \n \nHow is it actioned: The executive director will n ote any actionable feedback in an “office \nhours” Asana project and discuss response actions with the Dir. Of Operations or specific \nmanagers as appropriate.  \n \n \nQuarterly Components  \n● Quarterly Meetings  \nWhat is it: All -hands meeting to update staff on GiveWell  strategy and key initiatives and \nprojects. We will be continuing to iterate these into more interactive formats and using \n\nthem as an opportunity to solicit feedback on ongoing initiatives (e.g. diversity) via more \nconcrete inquiries such as straw polls or  upvoting exercises.  \n \nHow is it actioned: The Executive Director and Director of Operations will debrief after \neach meeting to discuss whether ongoing, new or corrective actions are required in \nresponse to the meeting feedback.  \n \n• Quarterly Reminders  \nWhat is it: Givewell sends out a standard document on a quarterly basis with key \nreminders to staff. Staff have to sign off each quarter that they have reviewed the \nreminders. In that document, we reinforce our desire to know about any incidents staff \nmay experience and reiterate options for reporting issues, including reporting directly to \na board member (Holden).  \n \nHow is it actioned: The office manager is responsible for distributing and confirming all \nstaff have signed off. He also solicits any edits to  the document from select managers \nprior to distribution every quarter. The individuals receiving any complaints are \nresponsible for responding to any grievances, including any that might rise to the level of \ntriggering our incident response protocol.  \nRout ine Ongoing Components  \n● After -Action Surveys/Polls  \nWhat is it: employees are asked via anonymous poll to rate all team meetings and various \naspects of social cohesion events. Polls are the bluntest and least intensive form of \nfeedback and are intended to provide a general barometer on the success of an eve nt or \nthe general health of standing meetings. Surveys are slightly more detailed and will be \nused less frequently for the purposes of assessing specific componentsof an event, the \nsuccess of new or changed events, or to get immediate feedback while impres sions are \nfresh in people’s minds.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Event owners will review the feedback and share with the Director of \nOperations, Executive Director, or other staff as appropriate. Combined annual results \nmay be provided to staff when and if that se ems usefully informative.  \nOpportunistic/Ad Hoc Components  \n● Round Tables  \nWhat is it: Round tables consist of opt -in group discussions focused on a specific topic of \ntheme. We will be more intentionally utilizing this format to allow staff with an interest \nin particular initiatives to keep up to date on progress, provide perspectives and input \nduring development stages, and to solicit staff feedback on critical questions or overall \nemployee buy -in and satisfaction.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Round table facilitators  will determine the particular method of \nfeedback for any given round table. This might entail anonymous or attributed polling, \n\nfacilitated discussion, coding comments from meeting minutes, etc. The facilitator will be \nthe primary person responsible for in terpreting and actioning the feedback but may also \ncoordinate with other managers/directors as appropriate.  \n \nEmployee LifeCycle  \nThe following are components of the program that will be universally offered to all staff but \nwould typically be offered in an i ndividual setting, sometimes specific to their passing a \nparticular employment milestone.  \n \nOnboarding Components  \n● Six Week HR Check -In \nWhat is it: This is a dedicated 1:1 conversation between an experienced GiveWell staff \nperson (intentionally not a senior manager; currently Erin Wolff) soliciting feedback on a \ncomprehensive set of topics, including GiveWell as an organization, the onboarding \nprocess, the employee’s manager, the employee’s comfort level, GiveWell culture, etc. \nThere are structured questions as well as organic conversation based on the flow of \nconversation. We plan to add new questions focused on key areas of current interest and \nwill review these annually based on past feedback and the annual survey.  \n \nHow is it actioned: The facilitator takes  notes which are reviewed by the employee and \napproved for release to the Executive Director, Director of Operations, and the \nemployee’s manager. The employee can revise/redact any portion of their comments or \nchoose to not release it to any/all of those i ndividuals. Those that are approved for release \nare reviewed by the above individuals and action can be taken as appropriate in response \nto any specific areas of concern. The Director of Operations also plans to create a \nsimplistic meta -file to collectiviz e responses and review for any trends that may require a \nmore systemic change or correction.  \n \n● First Year Manager Check -Ins (approximately end of: 1 week, 2 week, 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, \n9 mo, 12 mo)  \nWhat is it: Our onboarding process includes a series of dedicated 1:1s intended to ensure \nnew employees receive necessary support during their first year by carving out 1:1 time \nthat is intentionally reflective rather than focused on day -to-day projects. While an \nimportant purpose of these meetings is to provid e the employee with feedback on their \nperformance, we plan to provide more specific guidance to managers on additional key \nobjectives for these meetings and specific topics to check on, particularly regarding \nmanager -report relations.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Managers have the primary responsibility for acting on the feedback \nshared in these meetings though they may seek additional guidance from other managers \nor staff.  \n\nTenure Components  \n(i.e. components offered routinely throughout an employee’s tenure at Giv eWell)  \n● Bi-Annual Reviews  \nWhat is it: GiveWell conducts performance reviews with all staff twice a year. These are \nhandled as 1:1 meetings between the employee and his/her manager. Although the \nmajority of this meeting is dedicated to employee performance, there is a dedicated \nquestion regarding things GiveWell, or GiveWell management, could do better. Once a \nyear staff are also asked to provide feedback on their peers (any GiveWell staff person). \nWe propose adding another dedicated question regarding improv ements the employees \nmanager could make to help the employee succeed or improve. We also propose \ncollectivizing the staff responses regarding general GiveWell improvements in order for \nmanagement to have a running, high level view of any trends, new issues , etc.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Individual performance reviews and feedback are reviewed by a \nperson’s manager and the Executive Director. They mutually agree on any action plans \nthat need to be implemented for the individual employees and/or manager. The Dire ctor \nof Operations would be responsible to updating and analyzing the meta -file on general \nfeedback and proposing any actions to be taken at an organizational level.   \n \n● Manager 360 Reviews (may be incorporated into the Annual Survey - TBD)  \nWhat is it: Curr ently GiveWell does not have a systematic process for gathering feedback \non managers. Certain managers have instituted informal procedures for gathering \nfeedback from their direct reports, but this is not universal or routine. We propose to \ninitiate some f orm of manager review which may be implemented via Flex’s annual \nreview or may be an independent process (tbd). In either case it will cover a broad range \nof manager strengths and weaknesses, employee comfort with their manager, and \nproposed improvements.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Managers would be responsible for reviewing their results with the \nDirector of Operations and the Executive Director and developing personal action plans \nas needed. They would also provide, at minimum, a high -level summary of the feedb ack \nto their reports as well as steps being taken to respond to the feedback.  \n \n● Remote Worker Check -Ins \nWhat is it: The Director of Operations currently conducts periodic check -ins with remote \nstaff. These are typically phone calls or video calls approximat ely every quarter \n(individual staff are contacted on a rotating basis). We plan to add a few dedicated \nquestions to these check -ins, focused on issues specific to remote staff.  \n \nHow is it actioned: The Director of Operations will be responsible for archivi ng and \nanalyzing the feedback from these meetings and proposing any potential actions to \nemployee managers or the Executive Director in response to individual circumstances or \nmore general remote -staff issues.  \n \n● Manager Handoff Check -Ins \n\nWhat is it: When em ployees change to a new manager, the former and new manager \njointly administer a manager handoff process in Asana. One step in this process requires \nmanagers to check -in with their former reports several weeks after the handoff has been \nimplemented. We pro pose to offer managers more specific guidance about key \nconsiderations to check in on during these meetings.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Former and new managers would be jointly responsible for sharing \ninformation to facilitate a smooth handover and if there are any problems, the managers \nwill be responsible for working collaboratively to develop next steps, involving other \nparties as appropriate if needed (e.g. Director of Operations or Executive Director). The \nDirector of Operations is responsible for auditing A sana to ensure that the handoff project \nwas completed.  \n \n● Weekly 1:1s  \nWhat is it: Managers host weekly 1:1s with their direct reports. These meetings vary by \nindividual. Given the diversity and potential effort to apply any change across the board \nwe are not  recommending any specific change to these meetings. It is noted here for \nreference since many managers receive a significant number of insights through these \ndiscussions.  \n \nSeparation Components  \n● Exit Interview  \nWhat is it: GiveWell requests all separating employees to participate in an exit interview \nprior to departing. This is a dedicated 1:1 conversation facilitated by a person of their \nchoice (or the Director of Operations or Erin Wolff if the employee has no preference). \nThe interviewer solic its feedback on a broad spectrum of questions about the employee’s \nexperience at GiveWell.  \n \nHow is it actioned: Exit interviews are approved for distribution by the employee. They \nautomatically are provided to the employee’s manager, the Director of Operat ions, and \nthe Executive Director. Similar to the 6 -week HR talk, we propose to add the information \nfrom these interviews into a meta file to enable better analysis and tracking of the  \nfeedback from this tool.  \n \n \n \n \n\nCharacteristic Matrix  \n  Component characte ristics  \nComponent  Comprehensive  Focused  Nuanced \nor \nDetailed  Confidential  Attributed  Admin  \nBurden  \nAnnual \nSurvey  Yes   Detailed  Yes   Medium  \nQuarterly \nMeetings    Yes Nuanced    Yes High  \nAfter Action \nPolls/Survey    Yes   Yes (voluntary\n) Low \nRound \nTables    Yes Nuanced    Yes (depends)  \n6 Week HR \nTalk  Yes   Nuanced    Yes Low \nManager \nSeries      Nuanced \nand \ndetailed    Yes Medium  \nBi-annual \nReviews    Yes Nuanced    Yes High  \nManager 360  Yes (on topic)    Detailed  Yes   ? \nWeekly 1:1      Nuanced \nand \ndetailed    Yes Low-\nMedium  \nExit \nInterviews  Yes   Nuanced    Yes Low \n "

Letter to the Audit Committee from Hood & Strong (auditors)  \nIII. 2018 Audited Financial Statements  \n \n  \n\nI. Comments from the Director of Operations  \n \nThe audit committee ( Tim, Holden, Julia ) unanimously approved the finalization of these \ndocuments for full board review. The only changes to the final documents per that review are  the \nfollowing aesthetic corrections : \n• Correction of a typo Holden noted on page 2 of the letter to the audit commit tee \n• Entering the date of closure into Note 2m of the Financial Statement . This corresponds \nwith the date the document was finalized after committee approval . \n• In Note 4 of the Financial Statement, combining the Net Assets with Donor Restriction of \na) the Ef fective Altruism Foundation and b) Raising for Effective Giving (REG) which \nare actually a single  pool of funds  but which were captured under different  names  in \nSalesforce for a portion of 2018.  \n• In Note 6 of the Financial Statement, correcting a typo that  inaccurately noted a donation \nas being from Open Phil LLC instead of the Open Phil Fund.  \nOnce the full board has approved, these documents will be prepared for public release on our \nwebsite.   \n \nAdditional information f or those not on the audit committee:  \nIn line with the results last year, there were no audit findings. In addition, this year there also are \nno official recommendations, merely updates on the prior years' recommendations.   \n \nI have reviewed the letter and financials and agree with the stateme nts.  \n \nI will draw your attention to one item that is not explicitly outlined in the management letter or \nthe financial statement - the presentation of our Outreach expenses.   \n \nIn general, organization expenses have to be allocated to one of three categories - Program, \nGeneral & Management, or Fundraising (this is most clear if you look at the Statement of \nActivities (p4) and the Statement of Functional Expenses (p6) in the draft financials). At a \nstandard non -profit, most of its Outreach expenses w ould be incurred by the Development team \n(to generate donations for its continued operations & programming) and be considered \nfundraising. At GiveWell, the vast majority of our outreach and the activities of our nascent \nOutreach team are more meaningfully considered education (of donors about our research \nfindings) and grant -related outreach (for other charities). As a result, we allocate a majority of \nthe expenses incurred by the Outreach team to the Program category.   \n \nIn the past, this was really a prett y nominal decision because actual outreach expenses were tiny. \nGiven the significant changes in our outreach plans (hiring folks to an official Outreach team, \ngreatly expanding outreach activities to generate money for Top Charities, etc.) Outreach \nexpense s could increase dramatically in the coming years and this decision takes on more \nweight. We have discussed this with Hood and Strong and they agree that this is the appropriate \nconceptual way to present the Outreach expenses. However, we and they are agre ed that for \nfuture years we will want and need to present a more defined narrative that describes our \ndifferent programs (ie. Research, Education/Outreach, and Grantmaking) and how expenses are \n\nallocated to them. This will have the added advantage of makin g the audited financials a more \nuseful tool generally.   \n \nIn parallel, we will be doing the internal work to ensure that we have appropriately defined \nwhich costs and activities should appropriately be allocated to Program and which constitute \nconventional fundraising (for GiveWell operating funds) and shall be allocated to Fundraising.  \n \nRecommendation  \n1. Approve these documents for public release  \n \nComments  \nI am happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the audit documents or the process.  \n \nPleas e don't hesitate to let me know if you have any other questions/comments.  \nThanks,  \nWhitney  \n \n \n \n\n \n  \n \nTHE CLEAR FUND \nD.B.A. GIVEWELL \n \nDECEMBER  31, 2018 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nREPORT  \n \nTO \n \nTHE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \n\n July 5, 2019  \n \n \nTO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \nTHE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GIVEWELL  \nSan Francisco , California  \n \nWe are pleased to present this report related to our audit of the financial statements of THE CLEAR FUND  \nd.b.a. GIVEWELL (Give Well)  for the year ended December 31, 2018 . This report summarizes certain \nmatters required by professiona l standards to be communicated to you in your oversight responsibility for \nGiveWell’s financial reporting process.   \nThis report is intended solely for the information and use of the Audit Committee, Board of Directors  and \nmanagement , and is not intended t o be, and should not be , used by anyone other than these specified parties. \nIt will be our pleasure to respond to any questions you have about this report. We appreciated the \nopportunity to be of service to GiveWell.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSan Francisco ● San Jose ● San Mateo ● Petaluma  \n\n\nThe Clear Fund d.b.a GiveWell  \n \nReport  to The Audit Committee  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nRequired Communications  1 - 3 \n \n \n \nAttachment:  \n \n \nLetter Communicating Deficiencies in Internal Control  Appendix A  \n \n \n \n\nThe Clear Fund d.b.a GiveWell  \n \nRequired Communications  \n \n \n \n1 Generally accepted auditing standards (AU -C 260, The Auditor’s Communication With Those Charged with \nGovernance)  require the auditor to promote effective two- way communication between the auditor and \nthose charged with governance. Consistent with this requirement, the following summarizes our \nresponsibilities regarding the financial statement audit as well as observ ations arising from our audit that \nare significant and relevant to your responsibility to oversee the financial reporting process.  \n \nArea   Comments  \nOur Responsibilities with R egard to \nthe Financial Statement Audit   Our responsibilities under auditing standards generally \naccepted in the United States of America have been \ndescribed to you in our arrangement letter dated  January 31, \n2019. Our audit of the financial statements does not  relieve \nmanagement or those charged with governance of their \nresponsibilities , which are also described in that letter.  \nOverview of the Planned Scope and \nTiming of the Financial Statement \nAudit   We have issued a separate communication regarding the \nplanned scope and timing of our audit as an attachment to \nour arrangement letter . \nAccounting Policies and Practices   Preferability of Accounting Policies and Practices  \nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, in certain \ncircumstances, management may select among alternative \naccounting practices. In our view, in such circumstances, \nmanagement has selected the preferable accounting \npractice.  \n  Adoption of, or Change in, Accounting Policies  \nManagement has the ultimate responsibility for the \nappropriateness of the accounting pol icies used by \nGiveWell . GiveWell adopted ASU 2016- 14, Presentation \nof Financial Statements of Not -For-Profit Entities, \nbeginning January 1, 2018.  GiveWell did not adopt any \nother significant new accounting policies, nor have there \nbeen any changes in existing significant accounting policies \nduring the current period.  \n  Significant or Unusual Transactions  \nWe did not identify any significant or unusual transactions \nor significant accounting policies in controversial or \nemerging areas for which there is a lack of authoritative \nguidance or consensus . \n\nThe Clear Fund d.b.a GiveWell  \n \nRequired Communications  \n \n \n \n2 Area   Comments  \n  Management’s Judgments and Accounting Estimates  \nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation \nof financial statements and are based upon management’s \ncurrent judgment. The process used by management \nencompasses its knowledge and experience about past and \ncurrent events, and certain assump tions about future events. \nYou may wish to monitor throughout the year the process \nused to determine and record these accounting estimates. \nThe following describes the significant accounting estimate \nreflected in GiveWell ’s December 31, 2018 financial \nstatements:  \n- Functional allocation of expenses – directly \nidentifiable expenses are charged to the related \nprogram or service benefited. Indirect expenses are \nallocated to programs and services based \nprincipally on the percentage of personnel tim e \nspent in each area.  \nGiveWell’s processes for estimates appear reasonable and \nare consistent with industry practice and U.S. GAAP.  \nAudit Adjustments   There were no audit adjustments made to the original trial \nbalance presented to us to begin our audit.  \nUncorrected Misstatements   We are not aware of any uncorrected misstatements other \nthan misstatements that are clearly trivial.  \nDisagreements with Management   We encountered no disagreements with management over \nthe application of significant accounting principles, the \nbasis for management’s judgments on any significant \nmatters, the scope of the audit, or significant disclosures to \nbe included in the financial statements.  \nConsultations with Other \nAccountants   We are not aware of any consultations management had \nwith other accountants about accounting or auditing \nmatters.  \nSignificant Issues Discussed with \nManagement   No other  significant issues arising f rom the audit were \ndiscussed or the subject of correspondence with \nmanagement.   \n\nThe Clear Fund d.b.a GiveWell  \n \nRequired Communications  \n \n \n \n3 Area   Comments  \nSignificant Difficulties Encountered \nin Performing the Audit   We did not encounter any other difficulties in dealing with \nmanagement during the audit . \nSignificant Written Communications \nBetween Management and Our Firm   The only written communications between our Firm and \nmanagement of GiveWell are the representation letter \nprovided to us by management (available upon request) and \na letter reporting control  deficiencies  (attached) .  \n \n\n \n July 5, 2019  \n \n \nTO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \nTHE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GiveWell  \nSan Francisco, California  \n \nIn planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of THE CLEAR FUND d.b.a.  \nGIVEWELL (Give Well)  as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with auditing \nstandards generally accepted in the United States o f America, we considered GiveWell ’s internal control \nover financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in \nthe circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the \npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of GiveWell’s internal control. Accordingly, we do \nnot express an opinion on the effectiveness of GiveWell’s internal control.  \nA deficiency in internal control exists when the design or oper ation of a control does not allow management \nor employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, \nmisstatements on a timely basis. A deficiency in design exists when (a)  a control necessary to meet t he \ncontrol objective is missing, or (b)  an existing control is not properly designed so that, even if the control \noperates as designed, the control objective would not be met. A deficiency in operation exists when a \nproperly designed control does not opera te as designed or when the person performing the control does not \npossess the necessary authority or competence to perform the control effectively.  \nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is \na reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be \nprevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. \nA significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal contr ol that is less \nsevere than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSan Francisco ● San Jose ● San Mateo ● Petaluma  \n\n\nTO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \nTHE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GIVEWELL  \nJuly 5, 2019  \nPage 2 \nAppendix A  Following are descriptions of identified deficienc ies in internal control from the prior year that we \ndetermined did not constitute a significant deficiency or material weakness:  \nSTATUS OF PRIOR YEAR RECOMMENDATIONS (as previously rep orted, along with status update)  \nFinancial Statement Disclosure and Presentation Items  \nObservation  \nTwo key areas of presentation and disclosure in GiveWell’s financial statements are its temporarily \nrestricted net assets activity and the transactions with related parties. While items in both of these areas \nwere properly recorded in the general ledger, the supporting schedules initially provided did contain errors. \nOnce these errors were identified, subsequent drafts were corrected by the contracted accounti ng firm.  \nRecommendation  \nWe suggest that GiveWell ensure that these important areas are appropriately reviewed including greater \nlevel of collaboration between the contracted accounting firm and GiveWell’s management team to ensure \npresentation and disclosure of these items are accurate.  \nStatus  \nThis recommendation has been implemented.  \n  \n\nTO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \nTHE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GIVEWELL  \nJuly 5, 2019  \nPage 3 \nAppendix A   \nNew Not -For-Profit Reporting Requirements  \nGiveWell  will be expected to adopt the new accounting pronouncement, ASU 2016- 14, Not-For-Profit \nEntities (Topic 958): Presentation of Financial Statements of Not -For-Profit Entities  for its year ending \nDecember  31, 2018.  The adoption of this new standard will ne cessitate presentation changes in GiveWell ’s \nfinancial statements and footnotes as follows:  \n \nReporting \nRequirements  Recommended Actions for GiveWell \nNet asset terminology  The current terminology of unrestricted, temporarily and permanently \nrestricted net assets will change to “Net assets with donor restrictions” and “Net \nassets without donor restrictions.” There is no action needed.  This will be a \nrelatively simple wording change, which we will facilitate as the December 31, \n2018 financial statements are drafted.  \nFunctional expenses  Instead of reporting the functional expenses as a supplemental schedule, \nGiveWell  will need to include this as one of the standard statements or as a \nseparate footnote. Additionally, GiveWell  will need to disclose  in a bit more \ndetail, the methodology employed for its functional expense allocations.  \nLiquidity disclosures  GiveWell  will be required to disclose the “financial assets available for general \nexpenditures in the next 12 months”.  This will require GiveWell  to identify its \nfinancial assets available to be used for general expenditure, along with any \nrestrictions or other encum brances that would prevent the assets from being \nused for general expenditures. Additionally, GiveWell  would also need to \ndisclose its short -term cash management policies.   \nWe recommend that GiveWell  begin to compile the narrative language for \nthese polic ies and prepare the worksheets necessary to calculate its financial \nassets available for general expenditure.  \n \nStatus  \nThis recommendation has been implemented.  \n  \n\nTO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  \nTHE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GIVEWELL  \nJuly 5, 2019  \nPage 4 \nAppendix A   \nUndeposited Funds Reconciliation  \nObservation  \nWe noted that GiveWell’s  utilizes an “undeposited funds” account within its chart of accounts.  This \naccou nt effectively func tions as a clearing account for contributions not yet deposited into its bank accounts.  \nWe were provided an accounting of all the activity in this account  for the year and performed testing that \ndid not yield any errors (i.e. in our sample of contributions tested were verified that the selected items were \ndeposited in GiveWell’s accounts) but a detailed reconciliation of this account is not performed.  Without \na detailed reconciliation verifying that every contribution that flows through the undeposited fund account \nhas been deposited, it’s possible that errors could go undetected.  \nRecommendation  \nWe recommend that GiveWell perform regular reconciliations for undeposited funds at the same frequency \nand approval process as the cash account reconciliations.  \nStatus  \nThis recommendation has been implemented.  \nFunctional Expense Presentation  \nObservation  \nWe noted that GiveWell has included a line item on its functional expense called “donated goods and \nservices”.  The functional expense presentation should only include natural expense classifications such as \nrent or advertising. \nRecommendation  \nWe recommend that GiveWell  begin to record its in- kind expenses in a manner that allows for these \nexpenses to easily be presented into their respective natural expense categories.   \nStatus  \nGiveWell has  changed its manner of recording its in- kind expenses that now allows for separat e reporting \nof the different type of in- kind expenses incurred but elected to continue to present its in -kind expenses all \ncombined into one line item  on the statement of functional expenses.  \n \nThis letter is intended solely for the information and use of management and GiveWell’s Audit Committee \nand is not intended to be, and should not be, used by anyone other than these specified parties. We appreciate \nserving GiveWell and would be happy to assist you in addressing and implementing any of the suggestions  \nin this letter.  \n \n\n\nTHE CLEAR FUND \nD.B.A. GIVEWELL\nDECEMBER 31, 2018 \nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS ’ REPORT  \nAND \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS  \n\nThe Clear Fund d.b.a.

GIVEWELL \nSan Francisco , California  \n \nReport on the Financial Statements   \nWe have audited the accom pany ing financial statements of THE CLEAR FUND d.b.a. GIVEWELL \n(GiveWell ), which comprise the statement of financial position as of December 31 , 2018, and the related \nstatements of activities and changes in net assets, functional  expenses and cash flows fo r the year then \nended, and the related notes to the financial statements.  \nManagement’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements  \nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in \naccordance with account ing principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes \nthe design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair \npresentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatem ent, whether due to fraud or \nerror.  \nAuditor s’ Responsibility   \nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We \nconducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards ge nerally accepted in the United States of \nAmerica. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance \nabout whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.  \nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the am ounts and disclosures in \nthe financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the \nassessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or \nerror. In making those risk assessm ents, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s \npreparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are \nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of \nthe entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating \nthe appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of signifi cant accounting \nestimates made by man agem ent, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  \nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for \nour audit opinion. \n  \nSan Francisco ●  San Jose ●  San Mateo ●  Petaluma  \n\n\n \n2 Opinion  \nIn our opinion, the financial statements r eferred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the \nfinancial position of GiveWell  as of December 31 , 2018, and the changes in its net assets and cash flows \nfor the year then ended, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted  in the United States \nof America.  \nEffect of Adopting New Accounting Standard \nAs described in Note 2, GiveWell adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) \nAccounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016- 14, Not -For-Profit Entities (Topic 958): Presentation of \nFinancial Statements of Not -for-Profit Entities. Accordingly, the accounting change has been \nretrospectively applied to all periods presented  with the exception of the omission of certain information \nas permitted by the ASU . Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter. \nReport on Sum marized Comparative Information  \nWe have p reviously audited GiveWell’s 2017 financial statements, and we expressed an unmodified \naudit opinion on those audited financial state ments in our report dated August 16, 2018.

GiveWell\nStatement of Functional Expenses\nSee accompanying notes to financial statements.\n6\n\nThe Clear  Fund d.b.a. GiveWell \n \nNotes to  Financial Statements  \n \n \n \n7 Note 1 -   Nature of the Organization : \nThe Clear Fund d.b.a. GiveWell (GiveWell) is a nonprofit organization incorporated \nFebruary 22, 2007, under the laws of the State of New York. GiveWell aims to find \noutstanding giving opportunities and publishes the full details of its analysis to help donors \ndecide where to give.  GiveWell also gives grants to charities, to improve incentives for doing \ndemonstrably effective work and sharing information on that work. GiveWell’s office is \nlocated in San Francisco, Califo rnia. \n \nNote 2 -   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies : \na. Basis of Accounting   \nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of \naccounting in accordance with accounting principles  generally accepted in the United \nStates o f America (U.S. GAAP).  \nb. Revenue and Support  \nGiveWell’s primary source of revenue is contributions from individuals and other \norganizations. Contributions and unconditional prom ises to give are recorded at fair  \nvalue and are recognized as revenue when the do nor makes an unconditional promise to \ngive. Donated securities are recorded at fair  value at the time of donation. GiveWell \nreports contributions of cash and other assets as restricted support if they are received \nwith donor stipulations that limit the use  of the donated assets, or if they are designated \nas support for future periods. GiveWell maintains variance power over contributions, \nincluding gifts  that are restricted by donors for specific charities.  \nDonated services are recognized as contributions if the services create or enhance non -\nfinancial assets or if the service require s specialized skills and would otherwise be \npurchased by GiveWell.  \nc. Cash and Cash Equivalents  \nGiveWell  considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or l ess \nwhen purchased to be cash equivalents.  \nd. Equipment and Intangible Assets  \nGiveWell capitalizes equipment  and intangible  asset  acquisitions  over $1,000. \nEquipment and intangible assets are recorded at cost and consist primarily of office \nequipment  and we b development costs. Donated equipment is  recorded at its  estimated \nfair value at the date of donation. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the \nstraight -line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets ranging from \nthree to  five years.  \n\nThe Clear  Fund d.b.a. GiveWell \n \nNotes to  Financial Statements  \n \n \n \n8 e. Grants  \nGrants are expensed following  approv al by the board. Contributions restricted to \nrecommended charities are granted to specific charities net of fees GiveWell paid to \npayment processors (primarily credit card processors), befo re being re leased from \nrestrictions.  Donations restricted by donors to “grants to recommended  charities” \nreceived during 2018 were allocated 56% to Malaria Consortium , 31% to Against \nMalaria Foundation and 13% to Schistosomiasis Control Initiative . The all ocation \npercentage is approv ed by GiveWell’s board of directo rs. \nf. Functional Expenses  \nThe cost of providing the various program and supporting services have been \nsummarized on a functional basis in the statements of activities and changes in net assets, \nand functional  expenses.  \nGrant expense is charged directly to pro gram.   Other directly identifiable expenses are \ncharged to the related program or service benefited. These include salaries and related \nbenefits , professional fees, advertising and travel, which are charg ed to the functional \narea of the employee who incurred the  expense. Employees who pe rformed work in \nmultiple functional areas prorate expenses based on the actual hours worked.  \nOccupancy related expenses are allocated to program and services based on a headcount \nby functional  category. Other indirect expenses, i ncluding those associated with office \nadministration, human resources, finance, general insurance and legal are all allocated to \nmanagement and general.  \ng. Net Assets \nNet assets, revenues, gains, and losses are classified  based on t he existence or absence of \ndonor or grantor imposed restrictions. Accordingly, net assets and changes therein are \nclassified and reported as follows:  \nNet Assets Without Donor Restrictions – Net assets available for use in general \noperations and not s ubject  to donor (or certain grantor) restrictions.  \nNet As sets With Donor Restrictions – Net assets subject to donor - (or certain grantor) \nimposed restrictions. GiveWell’s donor -imposed restrictions are temporary in nature, \nsuch a s those that will b e met b y the passage of time or other events specified by the \ndonor.  \nDonor -imposed restrictions are released when a restriction expires, that is, when the \nstipulated time has elapsed, when the stipulated purpose for which the resource w as \nrestricted has been ful filled , or both. \n\nThe Clear  Fund d.b.a. GiveWell \n \nNotes to  Financial Statements  \n \n \n \n9 h. Use of Estimates \nThe preparation of fina ncial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires \nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect  reported amounts and \ndisclosures. Accordingly, a ctual result s could differ fr om those e stima tes. \ni. Tax-Exempt Status  \nGiveWell is a non -profit orga nization exempt from federal income tax under Section \n501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code  and a similar provision for state taxing \nauthorities. In addition, GiveWell has  been determined by t he In ternal  Revenue Service \nnot to be  a private foundation with in the meaning of Section 509(a)  of the Internal \nRevenue Code .  \nGiveWell’s accounting policy provides that a tax expense or benefit from an uncertain \ntax position may be re cognized when it i s more l ikely than not that the position will be \nsustained upon examination. Management has determined that GiveWell has taken no \nuncertain tax position that  would require adjustment to the financial statements.  \nj. Advertising Costs  \nGiveWel l uses advertisin g specifically aimed  at encouraging potential donors to use its \nresearch, featured at its public website. The website provides prominent links for \ndonating to recommended charities . Accordingly, advertising costs have been allocated \nbetween fundraising and program.  Costs are expensed as incurred. For the year ended \nDecember 31, 2018 GiveWell incurred $268,906 of advertising expenses. For the year \nended December 31, 2018 GiveWell also received donated advertising expenses in the \namount of  $ 204,300 (see Note 6).  \nk. Comparative  Financial  Information \nThe financial statements include certain prior year  summarized comparative information \nin total, but not in sufficient detail to constitute a presentation in conformity with U.S. \nGAAP . Accordingly , such informat ion should be read in conjunction with GiveWell’s \nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, from which the summarized \ninformation was derived. \n\nThe Clear  Fund d.b.a. GiveWell \n \nNotes to  Financial Statements  \n \n \n \n10 l. Recent Accounting Pronouncements  \nAdopted \nIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting S tandards Board (FASB) issued Accounting \nStandar ds Update  (ASU)  2016- 14, Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958) Presen tation of \nFinancial Statements of Not -for-Profit, which changes presentation and disclosure \nrequirements for nonprofit entities to provide mor e relevant information about their \nresources (and the ch anges in those resources) to donors, granters, creditors, and other \nusers. These include qualitative and quantitative requirements in the following areas: net \nasset classes, investment return, expenses, and liquidity. Accordingly, the accounting \nchange has been retrospectively applied to all periods presented  with the exception of the \nomission of prior year functional expense and liquidity and availability of resourc e \ninformation as permitted by the AS U. \nAdoption Pending \nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018- 08, Not-for-Profit Entities  (Topic 958) : \nClarifying the Scope and the Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and \nContributions Made. The  amendments in this update are designed to assist ent ities in \nevaluating whether transactions should be  accounted f or as contributions, or as exchange \ntransactions, as well as determining whether a contribution is conditional. The \namendments in thi s ASU re lated to contributions received are effective for ann ual \nfinancial statements issued for fiscal years b eginning aft er December 15, 2018, while the \namendments related to  contributions made are effective one year later . Early adoption is \npermitted. Managemen t is currently evaluating the impact the amendments i n thi s ASU \nwill have on the financial statements.  \nm. Subsequent E vents  \nGiveWell evaluated subsequent events from December 31, 201 8 through July 5, 2019, \nthe date these financial statements were available to be is sued. There were no material \nsubsequent events that r equir ed recognition or additional disclosure in the se financial \nstatements.  \n \nNote 3 -   Grants Payable:  \nGrants payable at December 31, 2018 in the amount of $ 13,777,053 represents amounts that \nhave been committed to various grant ees, but not yet paid.

(GiveWell covers the full health insurance premiums for \nstaff, their partners and all dependents)  \n \nFoundations  \n \nNote that we did not update this data for 2019. A manual spot check of several of the charities \nfrom thie 2016 survey demonstrated that salaries have gone up but we did not feel there was a \ncompelling enough reason to investigate the remaini ng charities or use the updated data. \nBelow, we use the same data we showed last year: 2016 compensation data for foundations.  \n \nWe have private data from a 2016 survey of 131 foundations by Lasnik -­Broida Consultants, \nInc. in collaboration with The Croner Company.

We chose this tier because its median payout was the closest to \nGiveWell's money moved. GiveWell's estimate of total money directed to charities in \n2017 is $149,153,078.1 The next tier down in the compensation survey we relied on had \na median annual grants payout of $32 million.  \n \nResearch not -for-profits  \n \nIn July 2019, we pulled the most recent available staff compensation information from nine \nresear ch or charity -review -oriented not -for-profits: Innovations for Poverty Action, IDinsight, \nEvidence Action, Center for Global Development, Center for Effective Philanthropy, Urban \nInstitute, Guidestar, Charity Navigator, and Results for Development.  \n \nHere are the summary statistics for the salaries of the president, CEO, or Executive Director at \nthose organizations according to their 2017 or 2018 990s2: \n \nCompensation for Presidents and/or CEOs at 9 orgs from 2017 or 2018 990s  \n 25th percentile  50th percenti le 75th percentile  \nBase pay  $200,524  $238,499  $426,172  \nTotal compensation  $214,198  $269,159  $427,547  \n \nNotes:  \n● We have not adjusted for cost­ -of-­living.  \n● Details of this data are available in Exhibit A. \n \nAcademics   \nNote that we did not update this section for 2019.

Sections listed  in\n \ngrey are substantively unchanged from the November report.\n \n \n \n \nWhat is GiveWell's mission?\n \nWhat are our major areas of growth?\n \nWhat constitutes success?\n \nHow are we working to achieve these goals?\n \nWhat have we done recently to move towards these goals? How have we progressed? What\n \nare our plans?\n \nWhat else of note is happening at GiveWell?\n \nDocuments we have shared in the past\n \n \nWhat is GiveWell's mission?\n \n \nGiveWell's mission is to find outstanding giving opportunities and publish the full details of our\n \nanalysis to help donors decide where to give.\n \n \nWe accomplish our mission by finding the most cost-effective giving opportunities we can and\n \ndirecting as much money as possible to those recommendations (our money moved).\n \n \nNote: if we meaningfully expand our work on influence (the third bullet below), we'll probably\n \nwant to revise our mission statement.\n \n \nWhat are our major areas of growth?\n \n \nIn the next few years, we aim to increase our impact by:\n \n \n●\nFinding more cost-effective giving opportunities. \n​\nWe aim to evaluate opportunities\n \nthat go beyond the scope of the types of charities GiveWell has evaluated to date (more\n \nin \n​\nthis blog post\n​\n). This area is still new for us and the goal we have in mind is intended to\n \ncommunicate our direction; it's likely that we revise our goal as we learn more about this\n \narea. Currently, our goal is, by the end of 2022, direct at least $25 million per year to\n \nopportunities that we believe are significantly more cost-effective than the top charity we\n \nwould have otherwise directed funds to or conclude that the areas we're exploring are\n \nlikely less cost-effective than our top charities (or not sufficiently more cost-effective to\n \nbe worth the effort of exploring this new area).\n \n\n●\nIncreasing money moved. \n​\nOur goal is to reach $100 million money moved (excluding\n \nGood Ventures) by the end of giving season 2022 (i.e., January 31, 2023).\n \n●\nInfluencing institutional funders of global health and development.\n​\n We are\n \nexploring the possibility of influencing the giving of donor-governments, large\n \nfoundations, and multilateral institutions (e.g., the World Bank, Global Fund). This area is\n \nnew and we're uncertain about what constitute reasonable goals. We are currently\n \nthinking about goals like, within 5 years, direct at least $100 million to GiveWell's priority\n \nprograms or improve the cost-effectiveness of $500 million in institutional funding by at\n \nleast 2x.\n \nWhat constitutes success?\n \n \n●\nIf we achieve none of these goals, we would consider that a failure.\n \n●\nIf we achieve one of these goals, we consider that to be on expectations and a\n \nsignificant improvement in GiveWell's overall impact.\n \n●\nIf we achieve two or more of these goals, we would consider that to be an exceptional\n \nimprovement in GiveWell's overall impact.\n \nHow are we working to achieve these goals?\n \n \nMy (Elie's) top priorities are:\n \n \n●\nRecruiting researchers and managing/training newly hired senior researchers who\n \ncan contribute at a senior level, either as individual contributors or managers\n​\n. This\n \nis currently our biggest bottleneck to achieving our research goals. I also believe that\n \nmore senior researchers will meaningfully support our outreach goals by (a)\n \nconducting/leading outreach-oriented research projects, (b) improving our transparency,\n \nand (c) improving how we demonstrate / communicate about the quality of our work.\n \n●\nLeading our efforts to increase money moved. \n​\nI manage Jim Bobowski, our VP of\n \nMarketing and Stephanie Stojanovic, our Major Gifts Officer.\n \n \n○\nJim leads our efforts to acquire new donors via mass marketing and manages a\n \nteam of three.\n \n \n○\nSteph leads our efforts to retain and increase donations from people who've\n \ngiven before. She also works closely with me on opportunities to engage with\n \nnew, ultra-high-net-worth donors. She manages a team of three.\n \n●\nExploring institutional influence as a potential long-term priority for GiveWell.\n \nMichael Eddy leads this work. Buddy Shah starts in July and will lead this work and\n \nmanage Michael.\n \n\nWhat have we done recently to move towards these goals? How have we progressed?\n \nWhat are our plans?\n \n \n●\nRecruiting researchers.\n \n \n○\nIn late 2019:\n \n \n■\nTwo senior researchers started at GiveWell. One of them has begun\n \nmanaging a team of two.\n \n \n○\nGoing forward:\n \n■\nIn the next 2-3 years, I roughly hope to hire ~2 more\n \nmanager/director-level researchers and 3-5 more excellent individual\n \ncontributor researchers .\n \n■\nIn December 2019-February 2020, we participated in the American\n \nEconomic Association job market for students who expect to receive their\n \nPhDs in economics in 2020. We received many more, higher quality\n \napplications than in past years, but we've been disappointed by\n \napplicants' performance on our work trials. We still have a number of\n \ncandidates in the pipeline. My best guess is that we'll make 0-1 offers\n \nfrom this pool.\n \n■\nWe believe that having a background in evidence-based policy (i.e., using\n \nevidence to inform policy decisions) enabled one new staff member to\n \ncontribute very early at GiveWell. We're currently identifying and\n \ncontacting individuals who have similar career paths to discuss the\n \npossibility of their joining GiveWell.\n \n●\nIncreasing money moved.\n \n \n○\nIn 2019:\n \n \n■\nWe hired Jim Bobowski to lead our marketing efforts.\n \n \n■\nOur Head of Growth led projects to revamp our homepage and advertise\n \non podcasts. We suspect that the homepage revamp drove a significant\n \namount ($500k-$2 million) in donations, but we haven't yet analyzed the\n \ndata to be confident. We spent $150,000 on podcasts ads (which we\n \nsupported with matching funds) and they drove more than $500,000 in\n \nnew donations.\n \n■\nMajor Gifts raised more than $1 million in counterfactual donations. We\n \nalso believe their work on a direct mail and email campaign led to\n \napproximately another ~$1 million in donations but we haven't yet\n \nanalyzed this to be confident.\n \n○\nIn 2020:\n \n■\nMarketing aims to increase our podcast advertising spend from $150,000\n \nto $500,000, assuming we can identify high-quality advertising\n \nopportunities and find matching funds. We also aims to spend $500,000\n \n\non paid advertising in other places aiming for a first-year tracked return on\n \ninvestment of 1.5.\n \n1\n■\nMajor gifts aims to increase total giving among existing major donors by\n \n$5-7 million.\n \n \n●\nExploring institutional Influence.\n \n○\nThis is still very early stage and a work in progress. I'm happy to talk through this\n \nin greater detail if there's interest, but don't think there's any specific part of this\n \nthat's worth discussing in detail at this point.\n \n \n○\nWe have set tentative goals for 2020, but we think these are reasonably likely to\n \nchange as we (along with incoming new staff refine our thinking about the\n \napproach we should take in this domain.\n \nWhat else of note is happening at GiveWell?\n \nOverall, GiveWell's nearly 40-person team is more capable than it has ever been. We're making\n \nprogress in every single area.\n \n \n●\nOperations added two Operations Associates in 2019 who are enabling Operations to\n \ntake on more than it has in the past.\n \n●\nThetop charities team is running smoothly, with nearly no involvement from the CEO.\n \n●\nIndividual researchers are working to find new giving opportunities.\n \n \nDocuments we have shared in the past\n \n●\nDocument from the November 2019 board meeting [link redacted]\n \n \n●\nDocument from the July 2019 board meeting [link redacted]\n \n○\nUpdate to that document shared before the meeting [link redacted]\n \n●\n2017 strategy review [link redacted]\n \n●\n2018 strategy review [link redacted]\n \n1\n Historically, we've retained approximately 100% of dollars donated over time. This means that if we\n \nreceive $1 in year one, our best guess is that we'll continue to receive $1 into the future. Therefore, we\n \nsee a 1.5 return on a dollar invested in year 1 as a good return on investment.\n "

As an organization, GiveWell comprises several domains of various sizes: research,\n \noutreach, operations, engagement, and management.\n Each domain has its own \n​\ndomain goal\n​\n:\n \n1\n●\nResearch: Identify the most cost-effective opportunities to support and make a public\n \ncase for them.\n \n●\nOutreach: Maximize the philanthropic dollars influenced by GiveWell's\n \nrecommendations.\n \n●\nOperations: Optimize GiveWell's development and use of human, financial and material\n \nresources to achieve its goals.\n \n●\nEngagement: Optimize the impact of institutional funders.\n \n●\nManagement: Establish and direct GiveWell's strategy to achieve its overarching goal.\n \n \nEach domain can then be defined as having 2 or 3 \n​\nsubgoals\n​\n, outlined in the 'domain subgoals'\n \ntab of \n​\nthis document\n​\n. Just as the domain goals support GiveWell's overarching goal, the\n \nsubgoals support each domain goal.\n \n \nWithin each subgoal, we set \n​\nobjectives\n​\n for the year and for the first quarter (where applicable).\n \nThese objectives should be defined so that they enable us to easily assess success or failure\n \n(e.g., an objective like 'increase X' should specify the amount by which X needs to increase to\n \nbe considered a success). Each quarter, we will set objectives for the upcoming quarter, except\n \nin the domains for which we've already broken out objectives by quarter, in which case we'll\n \njust reassess progress on a quarterly basis. We will track progress in the 'dashboard' tab of \n​\nthis\n \ndocument\n​\n.\n \n \nThis scorecard and dashboard is a first pass at more clearly articulating the links between our\n \ngoal as an organization and each of the projects we're pursuing in the interest of that goal.\n \nIdeally, each goal and subgoal would be as specific as possible while remaining broad enough\n \nto fully capture that piece of work.\n \nWhy this work matters\n \nThe reasons for creating these plans and sharing them are twofold:\n \n1\n It's possible that the way we've defined 'engagement' and 'management' as distinct domains will\n \nevolve in the near-term, as these areas are nascent. 'Management' as used here is distinct from\n \npersonnel management.\n \n\n1.\nTo progress towards our overarching goal of improving the lives of people living in\n \nglobal poverty via improved planning. By thoughtfully and systematically setting\n \nobjectives for the years and considering how those objectives feed into our higher-level\n \ngoals, we may be able to make better decisions about which projects to prioritize,\n \nultimately increasing the impact of our work.\n \n2.\nTo improve staff morale and sense of engagement with GiveWell's work and mission,\n \nand increase understanding of the role each staff member plays in achieving our goals.\n \n \nDashboard\n \nThe \n​\nDashboard\n​\n provides the most coherent glimpse of GiveWell’s high level goals and plans.\n \nThis is structured in a waterfall fashion, each tab flowing out of the preceding tab, as follows:\n \n \n●\nTab 1 - Instructions\n \n●\nTab 2 - Organizational and domain (i.e. department) level goals\n \n●\nTab 3 - Domain level sub goals\n \n \n●\nTab 4 - 2020 key projects by domain\n \n●\nTab 5 - Detailed work plans (This tab is provided strictly for reference for those who\n \nmay wish to delve into certain plans in detail)\n "

          "text": "GiveWell 2020 marketing plan overview Summary  Marketing is new for GiveWell. We hired our first marketing lead in November 2019.  This year, we're focused on four main areas: ● Paid advertising ● Donor research ● Site improvements ● Performance measurement  Overall, we expect this work to move $1.5 million additional in 2020.  We don't plan to add many full-time staff to the marketing team this year. We plan to rely on vendors to provide additional capacity. Paid advertising Our goal is to build a paid marketing operation that directs significantly more money to GiveWell and our recommendations than we spend.   This year, we're moving towards this by (a) continuing to assess how much we can successfully invest in podcasts, the channel that has worked in the past and (b) get early indications of our potential ability to move money via new channels.  ● Advertising where we expect a high return. We successfully advertised on podcasts in 2019. We spent $180K and tracked ~$571K from new donors in 2019. We plan to spend $540k in giving season 2020 and aim to return $890k in first-year donations.1 ● Experimental advertising. We plan to test (a) podcast advertising outside of giving season and (b) other advertising channels (e.g., Facebook, search, retargeting2, YouTube) to see if they yield reasonable returns. We currently expect to spend $400k and return $200k in first-year donations. The results of these experiments will dictate which channels we spend more on in the future.   1 Based on past experience, we roughly estimate that approximately 90% of dollars given in year 1 recur in future years. For example, if donors give $100 in year 1, we roughly estimate that they will continue to give $90 in each subsequent year. 2 This article explains what retargeting is: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/retargeting-campaigns-beginner-guide. \n\nResearch We are conducting research with existing donors and non-donors to better understand how they view GiveWell, our website, and how they make their charitable giving decisions. This research will help shape our messaging, lead to site improvements, and help with our long-term strategic positioning. We have linked the documents below. So far, this research has not surprised us but has helped us prioritize changes.   Completed Research ● Customer satisfaction survey [Redacted] ● Donor deeper research [Redacted] ● User experience (i.e., visiting the website for the first time) research  Future Research Projects ● Non-donors - June ● Positioning - July ● Additional UX - July Site improvements Using the above, we plan to make improvements to the GiveWell website to increase visitors' ability to understand what we do, why they should trust our research/process, and lead more potential donors to make donations to GiveWell. We aim to make improvements that increase the amount of money we receive by $250,000 in 2020. Performance measurement We have a reasonable, though suboptimal, ability to measure the performance of our marketing work. We don't have high-quality estimates for what it costs us to acquire a new donor via paid marketing, nor do we have high-quality estimates of the amount a donor is likely to give over time. Knowing these values will provide a way to determine the right amount of money to spend on marketing to maximize donations. A note on team building Our marketing team currently consists of a VP of Marketing, a Head of Growth, a Marketing Associate and a Technical Project Manager. We plan to mostly use vendors and consultants to meet our needs until we're confident we should hire full-time staff.   We may hire some additional staff in 2020, but we are most likely to hire new staff once we determine which channels we are most likely to invest in in 2021 and beyond. "

The   goal   was   to   \nidentify   the   challenges   that   new   visitors   have   on   GiveWell’s   website.   From   this,   we’ll   work   with   \nour   researcher   and   designer,   Erik   Kennedy,   to   redesign   problematic   pages   on   the   site   to   \nimprove   conversions.     \n  \nWe   found   interview   subjects   by   asking   donors   to   introduce   us   to   their   friends   who   they   think   \nmight   be   interested   in   GiveWell,   but   are   unfamiliar   with   GiveWell   (have   not   donated,   have   not   \nvisited   the   site).   We   screened   donors   to   check   that:   \n●They   were   not   overly   familiar   with   GiveWell   or   Effective   Altruism  \n●They   had   donated   over   $300   in   the   past   year   \n  \nErik   conducted   interviews   via   Zoom.   We   worked   with   Erik   to   design   a   script   for   him   to   walk   \ndonors   through.   After   a   set   of   preliminary   questions,   he   assigned   them   tasks   on   the   website.   \nThey   narrated   their   thoughts   as   they   used   the   site,   and   Erik   would   ask   clarifying   questions   \nduring   the   interview   so   we   best   understood   how   users   approached   problems.   \n  \nErik   has   completed   the   first   round   of   research,   which   consisted   of   six   interviews.

The   main   argument   in   favor   of   building   out   donor   retention   programs   at   lower   levels   of   \ngiving   is   that   the   donor   pyramid   works   as   a   pipeline–it   often   takes   3-4   years   of   giving   at   lower   \nlevels   and   building   a   relationship   with   GiveWell   before   a   donor   makes   their   first   major   gift.   We   \ncannot   risk   losing   too   many   lower-level   donors   due   to   poor   retention   rates.     \n2020   donor   retention   structure   \n  \n  \nSTAFF DONORS APPROACH   \nGive   ~$50k+ 1:1   relationships   \n~350   donors     \n~70%   of   dollars   \n  \n  \nGive   ~$10-50k Modest   1:1   relationship     \n~1,000   donors   \n~20%   of   dollars   \n  \n  \nGive   ~$10k   and   less 1:Many   relationship     \n~44,000*   donors     \n~10%   of   dollars   \n  \n\n\n  \n*You   may   be   thinking:   I   thought   we   had   over   50,000   donors!   Why   are   there   fewer   donors   in   the   retention   \nprogram?   Answer:   we   can   only   include   ‘contactable’   donors   in   our   retention   program   as   we   have   to   be   able   \nto   contact   a   donor   to   be   able   to   influence   their   giving.   As   such,   we   have   removed   all   anonymous   donors   \nand   donors   without   emails   or   addresses   from   our   denominator   (as   well   as   those   who   have   actively   opted   \nout   of   hearing   from   us).   We   are   also   mainly   focused   on   donors   who   give   via   GiveWell   (not   direct   to   charity)   \nin   this   first   year   of   the   program.   Direct   to   charity   donors   may   become   a   larger   focus   in   later   years.     \n  \nBroad   2020   goals   \n1.Increase   engagement   opportunities   for   current   donors   and   build   greater   loyalty/affinity   with   \nGiveWell.     \n2.Increase   incremental   money   moved   from   current   donors:   \n○Major:   $3,000,000   \n○Mid:   $500,000   \n○Mass:   $500,000   \n  \nPlans/activities   to   achieve   2020   goals   \nEach   domain   \n    Better   engagement   Incremental   dollars   \nMajor   Ensure   gift   officers   work   their   \nengagement   plans .   Gift   officers   have   a   12   \nmonth   engagement   plan   for   each   donor   in   \ntheir   portfolio.   Through   monthly   reporting   on   \ngift   officer   activity,   we   will   ensure   that   each   \nplan   is   being   executed   and   donors   are   \nbeing   actively   engaged   with   each   month.     \n  \nLaunch   GiveWell   Council .   We   plan   to   \nlaunch   GiveWell   Council   (name   TBC)   so   \nthat   major   donors   have   a   volunteer   \nopportunity.   The   charter   for   the   council   is   to   \nhelp   GiveWell   attract   and   grow   its   \nsupporter-base,   so   they   will   explicitly   be   \ncharged   with   helping   outreach   initiatives.     Create   specific   giving   opportunities .   We   \nwill   be   pitching   top   charity   gaps   (for   example,   \ncountry   gaps),   incubation   grants,   and   seeking   \nfunding   for   special   projects   like   matching   \ncampaigns   for   marketing   channel   and  \nmessaging   testing.We   will   explicitly   highlight   \nfungibility   with   donors.     \n  \nPlan   and   make   enough   incremental   asks.   \nOur   assumption   is   that   we   will   ‘close’   about   \n50%   of   asks   and   about   25%   of   total   dollars   \n(some   donors   agree   to   the   ask,   but   end   up   \nmaking   a   smaller   gift   than   asked).   We   \ncurrently   have   ~$15m   in   asks   planned   for   \n2020.   Plans   will   shift   throughout   the   year.     \nMid   Monthly   personal   engagement.    Send   \nmonthly   emails   with   information   about   \nGiveWell’s   research   and   top   charities.     \n  Personally   solicit   all   donors   at   year-end.   \nSend   solicitations   at   year   end.     \n\n  \nPipeline   development   \nPipeline/pyramid   development   is   an   important   priority   across   all   domains.   In   2020   we   plan   to:   \n  \n1.Fast   track   donors   up   the   pipeline.    As   a   result   of   deeper   engagement,   we   hope   to   learn   \nmore   about   our   donors   and   identify   top   candidates   to   ‘fast   track’   up   the   pipeline.   We   plan   \nto:   \na.Research    new   donors   via   publicly   available   information   and   identify   those   with   \nhigher   giving   capacity.   \nb.Validate    donors   through   calls/meetings   to   move   donors   with   high   capacity   and   \nhigh   affinity   into   mid-level   and   major   gift   portfolios.     \n  \n2.Identify   new   major   donor   prospects .   As   we   have   limited   capacity   for   prospecting   work,   \nwe   plan   to   use   the   following   strategies   opportunistically   as   they   arise   in   2020:     \na.Referrals    are   a   strong   source   of   new   high-capacity   prospects.   We   plan   to   work   \nwith   the   GiveWell   Council   and   donors   in   major   gift   portfolios   to   seek   personal   \nreferrals   of   friends,   family   and   corporate   connections.   \nb.Partner   with   select   institutions .   While   we   don’t   have   the   capacity   to   roll   out   an   \ninstitutional   giving   program,   there   are   a   handful   of   aligned   companies,   wealth   \nadvisors   and   peer   organizations   like   Founders   Pledge   and   Effective   Giving   that   \nreach   out   to   us   and   are   good   sourcing   partners   for   GiveWell.   We   will   ensure   that   \nthere   is   capacity   to   develop   these   relationships.   \n  \nDetailed   metrics   and   progress   \nAvailable   here   [REDACTED].     \n  Year-end   personal   engagement.    Offer   \nyear-end   calls   to   discuss   GiveWell’s   \nrecommendations   and   answer   questions.     \nMass   Personalize   engagement.    Segment   donors   \nbased   on   past   behavior.   Move   to   donor-   and   \nbenefit-focused   communications.   \n  \nSend   year-round   communications.    Plan   a   \nconsistent   flow   of   communication   that   starts   \nout   thanking   donors,   moves   on   to   cultivating   \nthem   with   impact   stories,   and   finally   solicits   \nthem   with   a   compelling   ask.     Test   messaging   and   calls   to   action.    Tests   \ninclude   recurring   gift   messaging,   matching   \ngifts,   funding   gaps,   etc.     \n  \n  \nSolicit   donors   throughout   the   year.    Create   \nurgency   outside   of   year-end   to   seek   multiple   \ngifts   or   shift   donors   to   give   ahead   of   cycle.   \nTests   include   integrating   with   marketing   \ncampaigns,   using   external   events   (e.g.   World   \nMalaria   Day),   quarterly   allocations,   etc.   "

          "text": "  \nCOVID-19   Effects   on   GiveWell   \nSummary   \n  \nThis   is   a   short   document   covering   the   major   ways   in   which   COVID-19   has   affected   GiveWell   \nand   our   2020   plans.   \n  \nCOVID-19   has   had   major   effects   on   where   we   work   (all   remotely)   and   has   modestly   reduced   the   \namount   of   time   many   staff   (especially   parents)   can   work,   but   we   don't   expect   it   to   have   major   \neffects   on   GiveWell's   plans   for   2020   or   the   future.   \nOperating   Funding   \n  \nGiveWell   has   a   substantial   amount   of   operating   reserves,   and   we   expect   that   the   operating   \nfunding   we   receive   in   2020   will   cover   our   growing   expenses.   Given   our   fundraising   expectations   \nand   reserves,   we   plan   to   operate   in   2020   as   we   planned   to   before   COVID-19.   \n  \nAttachment   E   provides   more   detail.   In   short,   we   currently   project   raising   $13.4   million   in   2020   \nand   spending   $11.2   million.   In   a   severely   negative   scenario,   we   anticipate   raising   $8.5   million.   \nWe   currently   hold   $17   million   in   reserves.   \nResearch   \n●COVID-specific   research.    Two   staff   members   are   now   working   full-time   on   \nCOVID-19-related   research   and   grantmaking.   We   expect   this   to   continue   for   at   least   \nanother   6   weeks   but   it   may   end   after   that.   As   of   May   12th,   we   have   made   three   grants   to   \nCOVID-19-specific   projects .     \n●Top   charities.    We   expect   that   our   top   charities   will   have   less   room   for   more   funding   in   \n2020   than   they   otherwise   would   have   because   COVID   has   slowed   their   ability   to   run   \nprograms.     \n●New   opportunities.    COVID   has   slowed   our   work   looking   for   new   top   charities   and   new   \ngiving   opportunities   in   public   health   regulation   because   organizations'   work   has   been   \ndisrupted.   We're   in   close   contact   with   the   most   promising   organizations   so   that   we   can   \nresume   our   research   when   possible.   There   are   some   organizations   (e.g.,   New   \nIncentives,   where   we   recently   received   results   from   an   RCT   we   funded   of   its   work)   \nwhere   our   evaluation   can   go   ahead   notwithstanding   COVID.   \nOutreach     \nMajor   Gifts   and   the   donor   retention   team   are   in   the   process   of   contacting   our   major   donors   to   \nunderstand   the   extent   to   which   COVID   will   affect   their   giving   plans   in   2020.   Overall,   the   donors   \nthey   have   talked   to   have   said   that   COVID   will   not   have   a   major   effect   on   their   giving.     \n\n  \nOur   marketing   work   is   new,   and   we   have   relatively   little   basis   on   which   to   make   projections.   \nBased   on   the   data   the   retention   team   has   gathered   and   the   fact   that   GiveWell   donors   are   \ncontinuing   to   give,   we   currently   expect   that   marketing   will   move   approximately   as   much   money   \nas   we   expected   pre-COVID.   We   continue   to   follow   this   data   closely   so   that   we   quickly   update   \nour   forecasts   if   the   situation   changes.   \nOperations   \nAll   GiveWell   staff   now   work   remotely.   We   continue   to   pay   for   our   office   space   and   don't   currently   \nbelieve   we   can   reduce   that   expense.   We   don't   currently   expect   to   be   back   in   our   office   for   a   \nwhile.   \n  \nWe   run   a   weekly   survey   of   all   staff   to   ask   how   they   are   feeling   and   how   they   feel   their   work   is   \ngoing.   We   have   used   this   to   follow   up   with   staff   who   seem   to   be   struggling.   Overall,   people   \nseem   to   be   doing   OK   and   improving,   though   several   staff   are   struggling.   We   created   a   monthly   \nstaff   wellness   stipend   (redirected   from   our   office   snacks   budget)   that   staff   can   use   on   expenses   \nthat   improve   their   physical,   mental,   or   emotional   wellbeing   during   shelter-in-place.   \n  \nWe   are   tracking   regulatory   updates   that   pertain   to   employers   and   have   implemented   and   \nnotified   staff   about   the   relevant   updates   to   paid   time   off,   insurance   coverage,   and   retirement   \nplans.

What are our \nfuture plans?\nHow has COVID-19 affected our progress? How might\nit in the future?\nDocuments we have shared in the past\nWhat is GiveWell's mission?\nGiveWell's mission is to find outstanding giving opportunities\nand publish the full details of our\nanalysis to help donors decide where to give.\nWe accomplish our mission by finding the most cost-effective\ngiving opportunities we can and\ndirecting as much money as possible to those recommendations\n(our money moved).\nNote: if we meaningfully expand our work on influence\n(the third bullet below), we'll probably\nwant to revise our mission statement.\nWhat are our major areas of growth?\nIn the next few years, we aim to increase our impact\nby:\n●\nFinding more cost-effective giving opportunities.\nWe aim to significantly increase the\namount of highly cost-effective room for more funding\nthat we can recommend to donors.\n1\n\nUnless we find additional room for more funding, we believe that our future money\nmoved will surpass the room for more funding we identify.\n○\nIncreased scale at similar levels of cost-effectiveness:\nWe plan to continue to\nevaluate opportunities that are similar to our top\ncharities in terms of their\ncost-effectiveness and broad approach. Over the past\nyear, we have increased\nour research staff capacity and capabilities, which\nwill enable us to evaluate more\nopportunities than in the past.\n○\nBroader scope at greater levels of cost-effectiveness:\nWe aim to evaluate\nopportunities that go beyond the scope of the types\nof charities GiveWell has\nevaluated to date (more in\nthis blog post\n). This area\nis still new for us, and the\ngoal we have in mind is intended to communicate our\ndirection; it's likely that we\nwill revise our goal as we learn more about this area.\nCurrently, our goal is that\nby the end of 2022, either (a) direct at least $25\nmillion per year to opportunities\nthat we believe are significantly more cost-effective\nthan the top charity we would\nhave otherwise directed funds to or (b) conclude that\nthe areas we're exploring\nare likely less cost-effective than our top charities\n(or not sufficiently more\ncost-effective to be worth the effort of exploring\nthis new area).\n●\nIncreasing money moved.\nOur goal is to reach $100\nmillion money moved (excluding\nOpen Philanthropy) by the end of giving season 2022\n(i.e., January 31, 2023).\n1\n●\nInfluencing institutional funders of global health\nand development.\nWe are\nexploring the possibility of influencing the giving\nof donor-governments, large\nfoundations, and multilateral institutions (e.g.,\nthe World Bank, Global Fund). This area is\nnew, and we're uncertain about what constitutes reasonable\ngoals. We are currently\nthinking about goals like: within five years,\ndirect\nat least $100 million to GiveWell's\n2\npriority programs or improve the cost-effectiveness\nof $500 million in institutional funding\nby at least 2x.\nWhat constitutes success?\n●\nIf we achieve none of the three above goals, we would\nconsider that a failure.\n●\nIf we achieve one of these goals, we consider that\nto be in line with expectations and a\nsignificant improvement in GiveWell's overall impact.\n●\nIf we achieve two or more of these goals, we would\nconsider that to be an exceptional\nimprovement in GiveWell's overall impact.\nHow are we working to achieve these goals?\n2\nWe're working toward this goal on a longer time frame\nbecause it's newer and we expect it will take \nlonger to make meaningful progress.\n1\nWe exclude Open Philanthropy giving from our money\nmoved goals because we expect Open Phil to \nmake an independent decision about how much to give\nto global health and development.\n2\n\nMy (Elie's) top priorities are:\n●\nRecruiting researchers and managing/training newly\nhired senior researchers who\ncan contribute at a senior level, either as individual\ncontributors or managers\n.\nResearch capacity and capability are currently our biggest bottlenecks to achieving our\nresearch goals. Senior researchers will also likely\nsupport our outreach goals by (a)\nconducting/leading outreach-oriented research projects,\n(b) improving our transparency\nby publishing more of the research work we do, and\n(c) improving how we demonstrate\nthat out research is high quality, i.e., that our\nresearch is arriving at the best conclusions\nwe can reach.\n●\nLeading our efforts to increase money moved.\nI manage\nthe Director of Marketing\nand the Director of Development.\n○\nThe Director of Marketing leads our efforts to acquire\nnew donors via mass\nmarketing and manages a team of three.\n○\nThe Director of Development leads our efforts to retain\nand increase donations\nfrom people who've given before. She also works closely\nwith me on\nopportunities to engage with new major donors. She\nmanages a team of three.\n●\nExploring institutional influence as a potential long-term\npriority for GiveWell.\nOur\nManaging Director started in July and will lead this\nwork, and I manage him.\nWhat have we done over the past year to make progress\ntowards these goals? What are\nour future plans?\n●\nRecruiting researchers.\n○\nWe hired two senior researchers\n.\nThey started last\nfall. This year, we have hired\ntwo additional senior researchers.\n○\nWe have also hired three entry-level researchers.\n●\nIncreasing money moved.\n○\nIn 2019:\n■\nWe hired a Director of Marketing to lead our marketing\nefforts.\n■\nWe raised more than $1 million in counterfactual donations\nthrough our\nmajor gifts program. We also believe a direct mail\nand email campaign led\nto approximately another ~$1 million in donations;\nwe haven't yet\nanalyzed this to be confident.\n○\nIn 2020:\n■\nWe aim to increase our podcast advertising spend from\n$150,000 to\n$500,000, assuming we can identify high-quality advertising\nopportunities\nand find matching funds. We also aim to spend $500,000\non paid\n3\n\nadvertising in other places, aiming for a first-year tracked return on\ninvestment of 1.5.\n3\n■\nThe major gifts team aims to increase total giving\namong existing major\ndonors by $3 million.\n■\nWe have built a donor retention program that didn't previously exist,\nparticularly moving to engage non-major donors more\ndirectly. We will\ncontinue to build this out.\n●\nExploring institutional Influence.\nThis is still very\nearly stage and a work in progress.\nOur Managing Director started in July, and he will\ntake the lead on developing a strategy\ngoing forward.\nHow has COVID-19 affected our progress? How might\nit in the future?\n●\nOperating funding:\nWe have not yet seen material negative\neffects on our operating\nfunding. We are in a stable financial position. We\nreassess our financial position every\nsix weeks to ensure we've considered the most up-to-date\ninformation.\n●\nResearch:\n○\nWe have recommended grants totaling approximately\n$3 million to\nCOVID-specific opportunities. We wrote about the first\nof these grants in this\nblog\npost\n. We haven't yet published information on the\nremaining grants (~$700,000\nto IDinsight and ~$2 million to IPA [Innovations for\nPoverty Action] for an RCT of\ncommunity mask use).\n○\nWe detail the effects COVID has had on some of our\ntop charities in\nthis blog\npost\n.\n●\nOffice:\nWe don't expect most staff to return to the\noffice on a regular basis in the near\nfuture. Roughly half of GiveWell's staff lives outside\nthe Bay Area (reducing the benefit of\nreturning to the office). We surveyed staff, and at\nthe moment there is very limited\ninterest among Bay Area-based staff in returning to\nthe office (when permitted by local\nhealth authorities). If we were to reopen in the future,\nwe would follow recommended\npractices including mask use and physical distancing,\namong others.\nDocuments we have shared in the past\n[Note: documents from prior Board meetings may be\naccessed from their respective Board\nmeeting pages, linked\nhere\n.

However, we may indicate specific places whereredactions were made if they improve thereadability of the document (for example, clarifyingthat a link has been made confidential, or explainingthe jump from one topic to another) or may make minorclarifying edits.\nGiveW ell Foreign Registration\nExecutive Summary\nBackground\nAt the request of the Outreach team, the Operations\nteam has been looking into registration in\nforeign countries.\nThe primary expected benefits of this are to:\n●\nfacilitate easier, tax-deductible donations for our\nforeign donors (including bequests,\nwhich are currently very difficult);\n●\nimprove growth opportunities and prospects for long-term\ncultivation of major donors.\nGiveWell looked into five countries where we had existing\ndonors and/or a known opportunity\n(Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, the\nUK). We propose to move forward with\nregistration in two: the Netherlands and the UK.\nThis limited determination is largely based on two\nfactors:\n●\nA strong preference for easing into maintaining a\nforeign presence rather than plunging\nheadfirst. This allows us to test our ability to accommodate\nadditional reporting,\nbookkeeping, and management requirements.\n●\nThe UK and the Netherlands are clearly easier projects\nthan the other three countries:\nthe up-front and ongoing administrative burden and\nrequirements to register and remain\ncompliant are less demanding and more straight-forward\nin the UK and the Netherlands.\nAdditional proposal information [confidential] and\nsummary country comparison info\n[confidential] are provided here.\nAdditional legal considerations\nRegistering in foreign countries does constitute the\ncreation of separate legal entities. While we\nfeel the potential rewards greatly outweigh the potential\nrisks, this introduces the responsibility\nthat GiveWell has to comply with foreign regulatory\nrequirements.\nMost notably:\n\n●\nEach entity will constitute a separate legal body, registered locally as the local equivalent\nof a public charity, not a subsidiary of GiveWell US\n[Note added 3/2/21: after the Board\nmeeting, we learned that the Netherlands entity would\nnot be a separate legal entity.]\n●\nEach entity will need to submit annual financial filings.\n○\nIn the case of the Netherlands, the existing reporting\nalready published on\nGiveWell’s website is understood to suffice.\n○\nIn the UK, we expect to have to produce a separate\nreport and/or supplement our\nexisting report to submit to UK officials, particularly\nafter annual revenue exceeds\n£1m.\n■\nGiveWell expects the additional donations will be\nworth the costs for\nadditional bookkeeping.\n●\nEach entity will need to have trustees.\n○\nIn the case of the Netherlands, the GiveWell US board\nof directors can serve. In\nthat case, the board members would be subject to any\nfiduciary obligations under\nNetherlands law with respect to the Netherlands organization\nseparately and in\naddition to the duties that apply to them under US\nlaw with respect to the US\nentity. We are not currently aware of obligations\nbeyond the existing reporting\nnoted above.\n○\nIn the UK, a minimum of three trustees are needed,\nat least two of whom need to\nbe independent and one of whom, preferably, is resident\nin the UK. As we\nunderstand it, the purpose of having independent trustees\nis to ensure the entity\nis not controlled by another entity. This means in\nparticular that GW-affiliated\npeople cannot serve in a majority of roles. However,\nGiveWell’s CEO can serve\nas a “super trustee” with superior authority (i.e.,\nto appoint and dismiss other\ntrustees), but a quorum of the trustees are required\nto grant out the UK funds.\n■\nWe believe we can identify two additional persons\nwho would be eager to\nserve in these roles and who are aligned with the\nintent of GiveWell UK\ncontributing to and magnifying GiveWell US’s existing\nmission and\napproach.\n○\nGiveWell UK can outsource all operations to GiveWell\nUS, which we would do;\nthus, we expect GiveWell UK trustees to inquire and\naccept recommendations\nfrom GiveWell US as to the best disposition of funds,\nbut the UK entity must\nretain formal independence.\n■\nIn effect, UK funds would thus remain in the UK until\nthe GiveWell UK\ntrustees approve a recommendation made by GiveWell\nUS.\n●\nWe will want to add or increase our D&O insurance\ncoverage.\n○\nIn the case of the Netherlands, we believe we can\nadd to our existing policy.\nSince the starting revenue point is quite low, we\ndon’t expect this to add much to\nthe premium at first.\n○\nIn the UK, we will likely need to open a separate\npolicy.\n○\nWe cannot get a direct quote until these entities\nare more defined and we can\nanswer questions from the insurers more definitively.\n\nWe request that the Board approve expansion to foreign jurisdictions as determined by\nmanagement."

Approval of budget : \nVote on revised 2020 budget and 2021 budgets. Note that we will propose an update to the 2021 budget in early to mid 2021. \na. 2020 Update: We are not requesting approval of any additional budget in 2020. We expect 2020 expenses to be $10.0m, \n$1.2m below the $11.2m approved in mid 2019. \nb. Forward projections: The 2020 budget represents a $4.4m increase over 2019 actuals. For 2021 we are requesting \n$13.9m, which represents a $3.9m increase over the 2020 budget. These increases are primarily driven by new research \nand outreach staff, outreach discretionary spend on marketing, and modest operations increases. \n1. Application of single revenue cap : \nWe apply an operating principle to limit the revenue from any single source to avoid over-reliance on any particular donor. To \naction this rule we propose to irrevocably designate a portion of one donation as restricted for grants at GiveWell’s discretion. \n\n\nLooking Back: 2019 Summary \n\nLooking back: 2019 summary \n●We had strong revenue growth across our broad \nbase of donors \n●We spent less than we budgeted in 2019  (-25%) \n●Individual donor gave $7.5m ($3.9m of that was \nrestricted in mid 2019) \n●Open Philanthropy Project Fund grant of $2.5m \nincluded in 2019 revenue (although grant received \nin Jan 2020) \n\n\nUnrestricted Revenue projections vs. actuals for 2019 \nContinued broad-based revenue growth \nCommentary: \n● Open Philanthropy Project \nFund grant: $2.5m \n● Individual donor grant: \n$7.5m ($3.9 later restricted) \n12% of total 34% of total 41% of total \n13% of total \n\nExpense projections vs. actuals for 2019 \nWe spent $1.5m less than budgeted in 2019 \nwith underruns in: \n● Staff: $0.3m below budget \n● Advertising/Outreach: $0.8m below budget \n● Misc admin: $0.4m below budget \n\n\nLooking forward: \nRevenue projections and \nspending proposal \n\nChanges to 2020 budget since mid-2019 \nNotes: \n●Budget net decrease of \n$1.2m. \n●Decrease in staff (-$1.6m) \nand admin ($87k) \n●Increase in advertising & \noutreach costs (+$438k) \n\n\nProposed budget for 2020-2022 \nFocus of spending is new staff for research and outreach, \noutreach marketing spend, and modest increases for \noperations \n\n\nLooking forward: revenue projections and \noperational spending proposal \n●Our proposed expenses increase from $5.6m in 2019 to $17.8m in 2022. \n● Greatest spending increases are for new staff in the Research and Outreach departments. \n● We have already begun and plan to continue soliciting funding from major donors to support our growing \noperational funding needs. \n● COVID-19 has not had a material impact on donation levels to date, but we would reconsider our spending \nplans if this changed. \n●Based on current asset levels and conservative revenue projections, we recommend \ngranting out ~$1.7m in unrestricted funds per the single revenue cap. \n● Using our most conservative COVID-19 projections, we estimate that we could fall below the threshold of 12 \nmonths of assets as of July 2021. Hence no action is needed to satisfy the excess assets policy. \n● One individual gave an unrestricted donation that exceeds 20% of our proposed 2021 & 2022 operating \nbudgets. To action the rule of limiting our operations revenue from a single revenue source, we propose to \nirrevocably restrict a portion of this donation to grants at GiveWell’s discretion. \n● Given the current economic uncertainty, we propose to retain the remainder of this donation (~$6.3m) for 20% \nof our expected budget in 2021 & 2022. \n\nBudget approach – 2020-2022 \n●We request approval for significant spending increases for staff and outside services \nacross all the organization (operations, outreach, and research) to increase our impact \n○YOY, staffing costs increase 61% by year-end 2020; 60% in 2021; 31% in 2022. \n○Outreach expenses (advertising, PR, consultants, software, etc.) increase by $1.8m in 2020 \n(652%) followed by modest increase of $0.3m in 2021 (14%) and $0.6m in 2022 (23%). \n●Our request for staff expenses is based on budgeting for compensation and benefits \nwith annual increases plus projected hires; other expense categories are budgeted \nbased on experience and anticipated changes. \n●We request a safety net equivalent to 10% of non-staff total for unexpected expenses. \n\nSingle-donor revenue cap (additional details) \n● GiveWell has adopted an informal rule (the “single revenue cap”) that no one revenue source should provide more \nthan 20% of our operating funding each year. This forces us to maintain a broad base of donors, which increases the \nstability of our donor base and reduces the possibility of our research agenda being captured by a single donor. \n● Historically, we have applied this policy to Good Ventures and one individual donor whose donations might otherwise \nexceed 20% of our annual operating expenses. \n● The individual told us that it is likely they will give at least 20% of our operating expenses in each of the next 3 years, \nbut due to projected growth in expenses, there is a non-negligible chance they will not. \n● To increase the safety of our financial position, we propose retaining two years worth of funding from this donor \n(instead of one year). This will give us more time to adjust and raise more funding if the donor doesn’t give at least \n20% of our operating expenses in a future year. \n● In 2019, one individual gave an unrestricted donation that exceeded 20% of our combined 2019 and 2020 operating \nbudget. The board approved retaining 20% of the 2019 budget and 20% of the 2020 budget as unrestricted and \nrestricted the remainder, ~$3.9 million, to regranting at GiveWell’s discretion. \n● That same donor gave an amount in 2020 that again exceeded 20% of our combined 2021 and 2022 operating \nbudgets. We propose retaining 20% of the 2021 and 20% of the 2022 budget, $6.3 million, as unrestricted funding \nand restricting the remainder (~$1.7m) as part of the single donor cap. \n\nPotential staffing levels through 2022 \nWe propose significant hires in Outreach & Research in 2020 and 2021 •Note: this chart reflects the \nmaximum  number of staff we \nmight have at each date. We \nrequest approval to budget \nconservatively – i.e., to have the \nopportunity to hire outstanding \nstaff if we have the opportunity – \nbut we think it is more likely than \nnot that we won’t hire this number \nof staff. \n•We are particularly uncertain \nabout future hiring in outreach. \n•As of August 2020 we have 41 \nemployees on staff. \n\n\nRevenue projections for 2020-2022 – approach – \nCategory Projected growth – best guess Projected growth rate \n– conservative Comments \nOpen Philanthropy Set at 20% of operating \nexpenses Same \nPrivate individual Set at 20% of operating \nexpenses Same May not continue to reach 20% of total budget as our budget \ngrows \nOther $100,000+ donors 2020: ($0.5m) decline \n2021: $0.1m growth \n2022: $0.4m growth 2020: Same \n2021: ($0.1m) decline \n2022: $0.1m growth 2020’s decline is a conservative estimate due to uncertainty \naround the economy’s impact on giving season. \nDonors giving $10,000 - $99,999 \n2020: 32% \n2021: 1% \n2022: 13% 2020: same \n2021: -3% \n2022: 2% The amount from this group has been quite variable, but \ngrowth in the number of donors suggests this category will at \nleast be maintained and will likely grow modestly. \nDonors giving $1,000 - $9,999 Same as above. \nDonors giving $100 - $999 Have seen sustained growth from this group. \nDonors giving under $100 Have seen high, sustained growth from this group. \nAnonymous donors Donations received without designations and without donor \ncontact information are recorded as unrestricted. \n\nBoard Decisions \n\nSummary of board votes \n1.Vote to approve 2020 (updated) and 2021 budgets \na.The 2020 budget was approved last year.

It has questions\nasked by board members (plain text) and responses\nfrom GiveWell (blue text).\nAdded for publishing: Links to referenced documents\nare available on the webpage with\nmaterials from the Board meeting.\n===========================================\nAgenda (previous version, sent to board members last\nweek)\nBased on the questions below, we are proposing a new\nagenda.\nNew agenda is here.\nAttachment A: Insurance Review and Sundry Items (attached—please\nreview)\nNo questions or comments.\nAttachment B: GiveWell's Recent Progress and Future\nPlans (please focus on the blue\nhighlights)\nS e c t i o n :\nMajor areas of growth => A potential additional\ngoal\nHolden says, \"I believe that GW can increase its impact\nsignificantly by helping OP and\nother major funders time their spending effectively.\nI think this could be considered as a\nfourth route to increased impact, and even if it doesn't\nhave quite the same absolute\npotential, I think it should be acknowledged as a\npriority that can rightfully compete with\nthese in value-for-effort terms.\"\nFirst, some context for Board members. Holden and\nI have been talking about this\npriority for a few months. Open Philanthropy has been\nworking on a project to estimate\nwhen to give to maximize impact over time (i.e., how\nshould it allocate its giving over the\n\nnext ~50 years). We've also had our biggest donor after Open Philanthropy ask us the\nsame question.\nOpen Philanthropy shared analysis with us concluding\nthat the potential humanitarian\nimpact of Open Philanthropy timing its giving better\nis very large (as large as or larger\nthan other major goals we're working on). We reviewed\nthat analysis and it seemed\nsound to us.\nAdditional information on this analysis was provided\nby Holden per a request from\nTim. It reads:\n“If you have $X (say, $1 billion) available\nto spend on GiveWell's top\ncharities, you can spend it all now, or invest it\nsuch that you end up spending a larger\namount later (due to investment returns), or do a\nmix (spend some now, invest the\nrest, spend some later).\nWhen you invest, you get more $ to spend later, but\nthe giving opportunities might be\nworse (due to the world getting better and $ flowing\nin from others)—or better (due to\nlearning over time and new interventions available\nalong the lines of bednets and\ndeworming).\nIt seems very nonobvious how these considerations\nnet out, and therefore what\nspending path (in terms of how much we spend vs. invest\neach year) will do as much\ngood as possible. Our modeling suggests that having\na better model could save a lot\nof net lives (I can get this shared if you'd like).\nI think GiveWell is best-positioned to\nhandle at least some aspects of getting a good model\nof the situation, in particular\nhow good we expect giving opportunities to be in the\nfuture.\nAlso noting that this question applies to all donors—if\nGiveWell had a view it really\nstood behind on how to optimally spread out donations\nvs. investing over time, it\ncould encourage many donors to incorporate that model.”\nOne way of thinking about this is that instead of\njust helping people decide how to\nallocate $ between charities, it could be helping\ndecide how to allocate $ between\nyears. Both choices can cause $ to go further.\nSince then, GiveWell has been contributing to this\nproject by researching how the\ncost-effectiveness and room for more funding of giving\nopportunities in global health\nhave changed over the past 20 years and estimating\nhow they might change in the\nfuture. I expect that we will continue to engage with\nOpen Philanthropy on this work.\nWe've allocated about half of one full-time researcher\nto this over the past three months.\nIt's possible we'd allocate more in the future.\n\nS e c t i o n\n: Major areas of growth => Finding more cost-effective giving opportunities\nBuddy says, \"Allocating sufficient talent and org\nresources against this goal is a critical\npredictor of success. Especially for new areas with\npotential for ~>30x cash, we should\nensure that the people in the org who can explore\n'open-ended' investigations are\nspending sufficient time on this, and/or have a plan\nfor training others to be able to.\"\nTim says, \"For clarity's sake, I think this word should\nbe 'additional' or we should\nseparate out the goals of finding opportunities at\nsimilar levels of cost-effectiveness\nversus ones with higher levels of cost-effectiveness\n(which may not have meaningful\namounts of room for more funding in terms of our growth).\"\nHolden says, \"FWIW, I think GW may want to prioritize\nfinding additional less\ncost-effective giving opportunities, to accommodate\npotentially dramatically increased $\nmoved. (Obviously, it's better if they can find all\nthe RFMF they need at similar levels of\ncost-effectiveness to today's top charities, but this\nmay not be possible).\"\nWe estimate that we will identify approximately $150\nmillion worth of giving opportunities\nin 2020 that have a cost-effectiveness of 10x cash\n(i.e., 10 times as cost-effective as\ndirect cash transfers) or higher. We also estimate\nthat we'll identify $11.5 million that is\n5-10x cash.\nSome context: we previously (in 2018 and 2019) believed\nthat this amount of room for\nmore funding would likely be sufficient to meet the\namount donors were giving via\nGiveWell's recommendations. Three things have changed:\n●\nMoney moved has continued to grow organically.\nFrom\n2015 to 2017, our\nmoney moved (excluding Open Philanthropy) stayed roughly\nflat, between $40\nand $45 million/year. In 2018, we saw significant\ngrowth (to $61 million), and our\ninitial estimates of 2019 money moved are that we\nsaw significant growth again\nin 2019 (to $80 million+\n). As far as we know, this\nis organic growth that isn't\n1\ndriven by any specific change. We don't know that\nit will continue, but over the\npast 10 years our money moved has consistently grown.\n●\nOur outreach team is beginning to move money.\nIn late\n2017, we began the\nprocess of building our outreach team. As the team\ngears up, we expect they will\nmove increasing amounts of money in the future.\n●\nOpen Philanthropy may give more to GiveWell's recommendations.\nOpen\nPhilanthropy has written that\nGiveWell's top charities\nare increasingly hard to\nbeat\n. Open Philanthropy wrote that it planned to allocate\n10% of its capital to\nstraightforward charity (most likely GiveWell's recommendations).\n1\nThis is an early estimate and may be due to an error.\nIt is subject to revision.\n\nOur goal in this area is to significantly increase the amount of very cost-effective room\nfor more funding that we can recommend to donors. We're currently using 10x cash as\nour benchmark for \"very cost-effective.\"\nWe have not yet assessed opportunities enough to have\na good sense of what we might\nbe able to find, but we're targeting finding $100m\nof additional (i.e., beyond the\napproximately $150 million room for more funding at\n10x+ by the end of 2022).\nS e c t i o n\n: Major areas of growth => New areas of research\nGW said: “\na) direct at least $25 million per year\nto opportunities that we believe are\nsignificantly more cost-effective than the top charity\nwe would have otherwise directed\nfunds to.”\nNorma says, \"Are you sure that you want the timeline\nto be two years? Or for the metric\nto be spending $25 million, versus simply having a\nclear view on whether new areas are\nworth significant additional investment? In my experience,\nchange in some of the areas\nyou're exploring can take several years. Additionally,\nfunders who are new to that work\nmay take time to learn and to develop relationships\nneeded to unlock certain impact\nopportunities. Finally, I have observed many funders\n(including GiveWell) sometimes\nlearn about new areas with smaller experimental grants.\nIf it would be helpful, I'm happy\nto talk about related experiences I've had in my grantmaking.\"\nTims says, \"This seems tautological and true now (e.g.,\nwe direct more money to our top\ncharities than to charities that are not our top charities).\nAlso would be helpful to have\nsome definition of what it takes to be 'significantly\nmore' rather than just 'more.'\"\nNorma says, \"I agree with Tim that eventually, defining\nthe standard for 'significantly\nmore' would be useful. I also think it will be helpful\nto decide how you approach\nopportunities where even after the grant, it will\nbe tough to assess the impact on lives\nand/or Givewell's contribution. Happy to talk about\nmy experience with this if that would\nbe helpful.\"\nOur goal is to move $25 million per year to opportunities\nthat we believe are at least 30\ntimes as cost-effective as cash transfers.\nCurrently, we estimate that the most cost-effective\ncountry-programs run by our top\ncharities are ~15-20x as cost-effective as cash transfers,\nand these programs (Deworm\nthe World in India and Kenya and parts of Helen Keller\nInternational's vitamin A\nsupplementation program) have ~$20 million of room\nfor funding.\nWe've been working on new areas of research since\nearly 2018, and we have made\nsome small/exploratory grants, so although our progress\nhas been slow, I believe we're\n\non track to make good decisions about giving $25 million in two years. (For context, we\nare currently evaluating two grants that total $13.5\nmillion, one in alcohol policy and one\nin pesticide regulation.)\nS e c t i o n :\nWhat constitutes success => Influencing institutional\nfunders\nGW said: “\nIf we achieve one of these goals, we consider\nthat to be in line with\nexpectations and a significant improvement in GiveWell's\noverall impact.”\nTim says, \"It's hard to agree that achieving one of\nthe three goals is 'success' when the\nthird goal is so (understandably) ill-defined at this\npoint.”\nHolden says, \"FWIW, I'd call it a success if they\naccomplish the current draft-goal under\n#3. OTOH, I don't think 1(b) would qualify.\"\n2\nI (Elie) agree that 1(b) doesn't qualify. If we achieve\nwhat's currently written under goal\n#3, I'd consider that success.\nOther questions\nSection:\nIncreasing money moved\nGW said: \"We also believe [GiveWell's] work on a direct\nmail and email campaign led to\napproximately another ~$1 million in donations; we\nhaven't yet analyzed this to be\nconfident.\" Julia asks, \"Is there a plan to evaluate\nit?\"\nWe have done analysis, but I wasn't able to collect\nthis information in time for this\ndocument. We'll report out after the board meeting.\nSection:\nHow has COVID-19 affected our progress?\nGW said: “We haven't yet published information on\nthe remaining grants (~$700,000 to\nIDinsight.” Tim asks, \"Have we created a statement\nor documented anything about\nconflicts of interest with IDinsight now that Buddy\nis on staff?\"\nWe have a\nrelationship disclosures\npage on our website\nwhich includes potential\nconflicts of interest for GiveWell staff and board\nwith grantees. We are explicit about\nthese relationships in grant write-ups and blog posts\nabout grants (e.g.,\nthis one\nreferencing a recent IDinsight grant).\n2\nI.e., \"conclude that the areas we're exploring are\nlikely less cost-effective than our top charities\n(or not \nsufficiently more cost-effective to be worth the effort\nof exploring this new area).\"\n\nAttachment C: GiveWell Compensation Review Protocol (please read in full)\nNo questions or comments.\nAttachment D: Compensation Review 2020 (please read\nin full)\nSection:\nSenior staff compensation\nTim asks, \"what accounts for the large differences\nbetween individuals in base/total?\"\nGiveWell covers the full cost of health insurance\nfor staff, their partners, and\ndependents. Staff who choose to take GiveWell's health\ninsurance and have partners\nand dependents on that insurance receive significant\nadditional compensation relative to\nthose who use alternative insurance (e.g., their partner's).\nEveryone receives a health\nreimbursement account for dental ($450 per staff person,\n$225 per dependent). They\nmay or may not actually request reimbursement in any\ngiven year.\n[A section here was redacted because it included individual\ncompensation information.]\nSection:\nCompensation overview => Top ten salaries\nTim writes: \"Note for board members: I am particularly\nconcerned about diversity of staff\nas GiveWell moves into possibly attempting to influence\npolicy in other countries and/or\ninfluencing large institutional donors who effectively\nmake or influence policy in other\ncountries.\"\nNorma adds, \"Tim—Another factor to consider is how\nmany staff have lived for extended\nperiods in low and middle income countries. Of course\nstaff who are from low and middle\nincome countries is better.\"\nDiversity has been a major topic of conversation internally.\nIt has been a major priority\nover the past year (and a high priority in previous\nyears), and we expect it to continue to\nbe a priority for the foreseeable future.\n●\nIn 2015, we recognized that\nwe had made a mistake\nby failing to prioritize staff\ndiversity in hiring, which led our staff to lack diversity\nin terms of gender, racial\nand ethnic background, and country of origin.\n●\nWe aimed to improve our diversity by (a) working to\nbuild a larger pool of\nqualified applicants and (b) creating and utilizing\nwork assignments that were\ngraded blindly as opposed to interviews as the key\ninputs to our hiring decisions.\n\nWe did other things as well, including working with consultants, but A and B are\nthe two actions that I believe had the biggest effects.\n●\nOur diversity improved, but we still aren't where\nwe would ideally be.\n●\nIn 2019, Whitney formed GiveWell's Diversity and Inclusion\nGroup to support this\nwork. This group has 9 members from all departments\nand across levels of\nseniority at GiveWell.\n●\nThis year, we have continued to prioritize increasing\ndiversity on staff, especially\nsenior staff. For example, we retained a recruiting\nfirm to explicitly search for\nsenior researchers from underrepresented backgrounds.\nAttachment E: GiveWell Foreign Registration Proposal\n(please read in full)\nRegarding the UK entity, Holden comments: \"I'm interested\nin some commentary on\nwhether there is any reason to worry that the UK board\nwill have powers traditionally in\nthe domain of the current board—for example, whether\nit will control a significant % of\nGiveWell's assets or will be able to put out its own\ncontent using GiveWell's brand.\"\nWe don’t expect this to be an area for concern. The\ntrustees of the UK entity will have\ncontrol over those funds that are donated specifically\nvia the UK entity but not over any\nassets held by GiveWell US.\nRegarding content, I believe the UK trustees would\nformally have the ability to develop\ncontent, but the likelihood of that happening would\nbe pretty slim, in part because the\nCEO will be a \"super trustee\" with the ability to\nappoint and dismiss the other trustees.\nThe way we have envisioned this with our legal counsel\nis that there would essentially be\nno operations (other than, likely, bookkeeping) conducted\nspecifically within/by the UK\nentity. The trustees of the UK entity would be expected\nto outsource operational issues\nto the GiveWell US entity. This minimizes requirements\non the trustees and\noptimizes/streamlines decisionmaking, brand consistency,\netc. It is possible that we may\nwant to develop tailored content for a UK audience,\nbut as currently envisioned, this\nwould be a decision made by and then executed by the\nUS-employed team.\nAttachment F: GiveWell Financial Summary and Slides\n(attached—please read in full)\nHolden asked, \"Question about Attachment F, Slide\n16: Is it intentional that the last five\nrows of donor categories share a single projection\nfor the next three years?\"\nYes, this was intentional and follows our practice\nfrom prior years. Because we engage\nless intensively with them, we don't have a meaningful\nway of assessing why a particular\nsub-$100k tier would grow at a different rate from\ndonors in another tier, so those\n\nprojections take into account the actuals in those tiers from the past several years and\nconsiderations of the expected economic conditions.\nThe further we project out, the more challenging the\neconomic forecasting becomes for\nthese categories in particular. Generally, we felt\nthat taking a very granular approach was\nnot likely to be more accurate or useful than a high-level\none due to the current\nuncertainty in the economy and the newness of our\nmarketing activities.\nAttachment H: Executive Compensation Review\nSection:\nFair Pay for Northern California Nonprofits\nTim commented on the table showing compensation data\nfrom Fair Pay, a salary survey\nfrom Northern California nonprofits: \"The difference\nbetween this number and the other\ncomparables is really large, more than 2x. It does\nmake me wonder how we are thinking\nabout comparables.\"\nI don't think that this salary survey represents a\ngroup of organizations that are\ncomparable to GiveWell in terms of their size or approach\nto compensation.\n●\nThe category of the largest organization in the Fair\nPay survey is organizations\nwith budgets of $15 million+. More than $50 million\nwas donated to GiveWell\ndirectly in 2019 (including both unrestricted and\nrestricted donations), and we\nmoved significantly more than $100 million.\n●\nWe compete for staff with other organizations that\npay well for the non-profit\nsector (e.g., foundations, the World Bank), and we\nbelieve we should pay\ncompetitively to attract talent. My impression is\nthat many nonprofits must or\nchoose to pay significantly lower salaries, which\nsignificantly limits the staff they\ncan potentially recruit.\nWe included this survey in service of transparency\nsince it represents how nonprofits in\nour region pay staff.\nAttachment I: Resolutions for Board Vote (please read\nin full)\nNo questions or comments.\nAttachment J: Minutes of the May 2020 Board meeting\n(attached—please review)\nNo questions or comments.\nNew questions\n\nJulia asks and Tim seconds: Possible topic: the research\non giving now vs. later might\nconflict with existing goals, which are basically\n“move money now.” If it turns out that it’s\nmore impactful to advise at least some donors to give\nlater, would overall goals need to\nbe adjusted to reflect this?\nGiveWell to follow up.\nBuilding on Buddy’s comment about staffing: To clarify,\ndo you feel you currently have\nthe human capacity you need for policy work and other\nnew areas?\nGiveWell to follow up.\nThe estimates on more opportunities to be found seem\nto be backwards—it seems odd\nthat we would find 10x more 10x opportunities than\n5x opportunities. Are we so confident\nin the inputs to that process?\nGiveWell to follow up."
